          If you absolutely have to travel during this time, consider traveling
          via car if the trip is able to be made without stopping at a hotel.<sup>[1]</sup>
          However, this may not be feasible for everyone. So, if flying by plane
          is absolutely necessary, here are some tips to travel as safely as
          possible:
        </p>

            <strong
              >A plane actually has ventilation features that makes it quite
              safe to travel.</strong
            >
            Peterson from NBC explains it quite well:<sup>[2]</sup>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Fresh air continuously enters both engines at -65 degrees.
                Temperature and pressure are increased, then air is passed
                through a control valve and cooled by additional outside air.
              </li>
              <li>
                HEPA filters remove 99.7 percent of particles; new technology
                could destroy 100 percent of all bacteria and viruses.
              </li>
              <li>
                Filtered, recirculated cabin air and fresh air are combined.
              </li>
              <li>
                The aircraft is divided into ventilation segments of three to
                seven rows; you share air only with passengers in your segment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Outflow valve continuously releases cabin air and helps maintain
                constant pressurization of aircraft.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <li>
            <strong>Choosing the safest seat.</strong> Currently, more major
            airlines are flying at full capacity (meaning, they will be trying
            to fill every seat on the plane). The aisle seats may be your go-to
            for more legroom pre-pandemic, but these are actually one of the
            worst seats during the pandemic! During the pandemic, the window
            seats are the best seats to take. If your budget allows it, try
            getting a first-class window seat. First-class seats are more spaced
            out, which is always a plus!

            <strong>What to wear.</strong> Here is a list of clothing items you
            should consider wearing at the airport.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >N-95 mask or
                  <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008MCUS28/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=10c4d62020-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B008MCUS28&linkId=3b0079f18ab91bf3452247f35009e13a"

                    >Elastomeric Respirator</a
                  >.</strong
                >
                The typical surgical mask or cloth masks will not prevent
                inhaling the virus -- only prevent spreading the virus to
                others. Both the N-95 masks and Elastomeric Respirators prevent
                inhaling the virus. However, the N-95 masks are low in
                production, so they should be saved for frontline workers who
                come into contact with COVID patients on nearly a daily basis.
                The Elastomeric Respirator does the trick as well to prevent
                inhaling the virus.

                You will inevitably need to touch a lot of things at the
                airport, to prevent direct contact with your skin, wear gloves
                that are easily removed after your tenure at the airport.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Wear layers with long sleeves and long pants (bring an empty
                  trash bag in your carry on).</strong
                >
                With layers, as soon as you are at your destination, you can
                remove clothes that came into contact with the outside world and
                place them into a trash bag for 3 days. After 3 days, any
                remaining virus on your clothes should be mostly gone.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>What to bring.</strong> Here’s a list of items to have on
            hand when traveling.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Hand Sanitizer.</strong> Even when wearing gloves, make
                sure to apply hand sanitizer regularly after touching anything!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Alcohol Wipes.</strong> Before sitting down (on a
                waiting seat at the airport or in your airplane seat), wipe down
                your vicinity (the seat, the armrest, the seat belt, the window
                area, the table tray, your luggage, your passport, etc.). After
                getting out of the airport, sanitize your luggage and other
                belongings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Straw.</strong> When traveling you want to refrain from
                drinking and eating. But, if you must drink water, bring a straw
                so that you don’t have to remove your mask. Simply feed the
                straw through the bottom of your mask to take a sip of water.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Waterbottle.</strong> Most airlines are still providing
                complimentary drinks and snacks, so you can simply pour the
                complimentary drink into your water bottle and drink using the
                straw method mentioned above.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Refrain from eating, drinking, and using the restroom.</strong
            >
            This may be easier said than done, especially if you have a long
            flight. Try to eat a large meal before you head into the airport and
            use the bathroom as well! You should be able to go for the duration
            of the trip without eating. But, drinking and using the restroom may
            be more difficult to avoid. <br /><br />
            To drink water, try using the straw method mentioned in tip 4.
            <br /><br />
            To use the restroom, be sure to sanitize anything you will come into
            contact with at the restroom (toilet, faucet, etc.) and try bringing
            a couple of sheets of your own toilet paper.
          </li>

            <strong
              >Turn on the fan in the airplane and point it downwards.</strong
            >
            Turning on the fan will help push some virus particles to the ground
            and the airplane ventilation should help with the rest!<sup
