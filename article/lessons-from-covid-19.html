          <!--paragraph-->
          Today marks nearly 6 months since the start of quarantine. I still
          remember that last day before spring break when things were “normal.”
          That morning, you could hear my frustrations from my dorm room. I was
          struggling to pack my belongings. Somehow, I had caught a cold the
          night before. I quickly took some Tylenol, and before I could say one
          last goodbye to my friends, I was gone, hoping to go home quickly to
          rest. Clueless, I had no idea that that would be the start to half a
          year in isolation.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          I still remember when COVID-19 just appeared on headlines. My friends
          and I often discussed it. We became slightly wary of our families’
          Chinese grocery store purchases, but we denied that it would ever grow
          to the scale it is now. We initially thought that the virus would stay
          in China, but then it spread to Italy and South Korea. Suddenly, a few
          cases popped up in Seattle, but that’s ok -- it won’t ever come to
          where we are right? Oh, were we wrong.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          In February, I recall thinking my mom was unreasonable for buying a
          mask. “Just in case,” she said. Only a few weeks later did I get an
          email announcing that school would be online for the rest of the
          semester. A few months later, history repeated itself yet again when I
          received an email declaring my first year of college would be held in
          a hybrid, mostly online, setting. Mom knows best, I guess.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">

          While this pandemic has been truly unprecedented, it has taught us
          several lessons about our world, ourselves, and our science. Rather
          than regretting our past, we can only reflect and grow. Here are 19
          things I learned from COVID-19:
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          1) <strong>The definition of privilege.</strong> These past few
          months, I have been lucky enough to have a safe shelter and a loving
          family. I am also able to afford the extra costs of food and utility
          that come with staying at home. Yet, I can only imagine what those
          less fortunate than I am are going through, especially for those who
          lost their jobs, had their salaries paused, or live in a place where
          their mental and/or physical health is compromised. These aspects of
          life have never meant much to me, but now I recognize they are tokens
          of my privilege.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          2) <strong>The earlier, the better.</strong> Over these six months,
          the thought of “I wish this pandemic was over” has crossed almost
          everyone’s minds. With the fatigue and loneliness that comes with
          staying at home, people are then less inclined to social distance,
          making it more difficult to contain the disease. However, if we all
          stayed home for a couple of weeks at the beginning of the pandemic,
          then I believe that everyone would be able to go out more safely now,
          but no use in regretting! Just a lesson for the future :)
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          3) <strong>The smallest things mean so much.</strong> I looked through
          my camera roll at least 30 times over quarantine. Once, I got all
          teary-eyed looking at a picture of a sunset from last summer. Just by
          looking at it, I was transported back to that day and could feel the
          warm air and breeze in my face. I never knew landscape could make one
          so emotional.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          4)
          <strong>Time taken to reflect upon yourself is invaluable.</strong>
          This quarantine may be the first time you had such a long period to
          yourself. Pre-COVID, I was constantly surrounded by others that I
          occasionally forgot about who I am. Journal! Lay in bed while staring
          into the ceiling! Vibe to music! Thinking about who you are and what
          you want to be regardless of external factors. This is
          <i>your</i> life, not anyone else’s.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          5)
          <strong
            >Self-care boosts your confidence and serotonin levels by so
            much!</strong
          >
          Whenever I took a shower, did skincare, cleaned my room, or made a
          snack, I felt more productive and happier with myself. I always
          thought these tasks were “small,” but don’t undermine their power!
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          6) <strong>Take care of the earth.</strong> A positive result of this
          pandemic has been the cleaner air due to less traffic. I’ve also had
          the opportunity to take a lot more walks outside in quarantine, and
          it’s extremely relaxing to appreciate nature, strengthening my
          connection with it. However, as lockdowns ease, I’m afraid that will
          result in even more traffic and pollution, reversing the positive
          effects.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          7)
          <strong
            >The pandemic created the perfect environment for us to
            learn.</strong
          >
          One of the most notable features of 2020 was how everything negative
          seemed to conglomerate in one year. Police brutality came into light,
          shining on systemic racism in nearly every part of our lifestyle. With
          that, everyone (stuck at home) became more inclined to learn. While
          there were a lot of terrible things that happened in 2020, one
          positive thing was the willingness many took to be better.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          8)
          <strong
            >Hobbies should be something fun, even without friends.</strong
          >
          Pre-pandemic, every time I was bored, I would go hang out with my
          friends, but now, I can’t call my friends or be on my device 24/7.
          Hobbies are what I genuinely enjoy doing on my own. No external
          influences involved.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          9) <strong>Our world is interconnected.</strong> Just think about it!
          The virus spread halfway across the world to essentially everywhere in
          a matter of months. All it took were a few plane rides and cargo
          shipments. If that doesn’t perfectly show what globalization is, I
          don’t know what will.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          10)
          <strong
            >Because we are so interconnected, that means we are all one big
            community!</strong
          >
          The virus doesn’t care if you’re the President or a common citizen. We
          have to remember to take care of everyone. We won’t get through this
          without anyone being left behind.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          11)
          <strong>America is so deeply rooted in capitalism.</strong> Back in
          March, shopping for PPE with limited supplies and increasing prices
          was a perfect example of how the free-market is harmful to society.
          Not everyone could afford to stay safe in the time we all needed to
          be.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          12) <strong>Time zones are overrated.</strong> Sometimes, I have to
          jump on a call in another time zone, and I can’t count how many times
          I forget to convert it to my time. I just don’t see the point that
          extra hassle.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          13) <strong>The true meaning of a family.</strong> It’s ok to be
          annoyed with your family. In fact, I think it’s perfectly normal.
          Admittedly, my family often barges in during my Zoom calls or screams
          my name when I am in a call, and I can’t quantify or put into words
          how irritated I get. Yet, in the end, those little quirks are what
          makes us family, and whenever I leave for college, it’s these things I
          look back on and smile. That’s family for you.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          14) <strong>Meeting new people was hard already.</strong> Now it’s
          even worse over Zoom.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          15) <strong>Everything changed so quickly.</strong> The world adapted
          to wearing masks in a few months. I can’t even remember what it’s like
          being in a crowded area anymore. Seeing a picture of one sends me
          chills.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          16) <strong>Can life truly ever return to “normal"?</strong> I think
          that some methodologies we developed due to COVID-19 should carry on
          to our life even when the virus (hopefully) is contained, such as
          wearing a mask when you’re sick or public places cleaning routinely
          after people come. Hygiene is never a bad thing, and this pandemic
          just made us more aware of it.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          17)
          <strong>Science and humanities are intertwined, not separate.</strong>
          Up until probably my senior year of high school, I always thought I
          had to “choose” a field. STEM or humanities. Business or technology.
          However, recently, I’ve recognized that you never really have to
          choose because each field adopts from other ones. For example, this
          pandemic, on eye level, is just epidemiology and finding effective
          treatments, but there’s more to it than just science. Studying the
          social sciences allows us to find how is the treatment going to be
          equally distributed, how can we take care of marginalized communities,
          and more.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          18) <strong>Social media can be a toxic place.</strong> Whenever I see
          a post/story of others outside, I am more inclined to stop caring
          about the virus (which, obviously, is a poor decision). Seeing others
          share problematic opinions or take part in performative activism has
          also been harmful as my feelings get riled up. It’s okay to take a
          step back.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          19)
          <strong
            >Last but not least, we <i><u>really</u></i> need to vote Trump
            out.</strong
          >
          In case Trump’s misogyny, racism, and transphobia were not enough of a
          reason to go out there and vote in November, our “President” has
          handled the pandemic in the worst ways possible. It was first
          promoting the consumption of bleach/cleaning products for me. Then it
          was the boasting that we can detain the virus by Easter but refusing
          to wear a mask for me. Then it was rallying his supporters to believe
          COVID-19 is a hoax for me. I could go on and on, but you get it. This
          pandemic has shown us that our “President” can’t even protect our
          lives.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          As colleges reopen across the country, we can only hope that the virus
          will not breed on campuses. This pandemic is not a partisan issue. No
          one wants to get sick, but SARS-COV-2 does not pick and choose who to
          infect based on race, ethnicity, gender, etc. However, by wearing a
          mask and following social distancing guidelines for just a few weeks,
          soon enough this article will be a piece of the past.
        </p>

          <!--paragraph-->
          So what can you do? <br /><br />
          - <strong>WEAR A MASK.</strong> PLEASE. According to a paper published
          in The Lancet, any type of face-covering decreased the rate of
          COVID-19 transmission by nearly 5 times.<sup>[1]</sup> Pairing a
          facial covering with social distancing makes your risk of catching the
          virus virtually zero. Recently, a Duke University study found that
          neck gaiters may be more harmful than wearing no mask at all.<sup

          However, it’s important to note that this study was flawed.<sup
            >[3]</sup
          >
          They only tested ONE neck gaiter, which is not enough to discount all
          of them. If this is the only type of face-covering you have, please
          still wear it outside. Read

          Incarcerated populations are more than 5 times more likely to die from
          the virus.<sup>[7]</sup> In an article published in early August,
          COVID-19 conditions in ICE detention centers were extremely unsanitary
          as ICE officials do not wear masks or respect quarantine. In fact, 20
          percent of detainees have tested positive, and ICE has underreported
          cases.<sup>[8]</sup> Unfortunately, information regarding the
          conditions in both these places have been murky. <br /><br />-
