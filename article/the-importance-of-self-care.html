          <!--paragraph-->
          The past four to five months have been quite isolating and difficult.
          Having to stay at home almost every day has been challenging. Towards
          the beginning of this social-distancing period, I struggled to
          establish a daily routine and to keep up with my own mental and
          physical health. However, I’ve been able to use this time to learn how
          to take better care of myself.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          With school coming up soon, it’s no doubt that my peers and I will
          experience a steep increase in workload and stress. Taking care of
          yourself is incredibly important to reduce these stress levels and
          stay healthy. Too much stress can lead to more serious issues in the
          long run, including sleep dysfunction, heart disease, depression,
          etc.<sup>[1]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          To prevent these kinds of issues from arising we should implement
          daily acts of self-care into our routines.* In fact, practicing
          self-care has been shown to improve cognitive ability, including
          memory and focus. Making time for yourself gives you the chance to
          recharge and relax.<sup>[2]</sup> I am no expert, but here are the
          main ways that I have been practicing self-care during this
          quarantine:

          Exercise
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Staying physically active is something that I have come to appreciate
          during this quarantine. Maintaining an almost daily exercise routine
          gave me a sense of normality and helped me feel more energized. I was
          recently introduced to
          <a class="a" href="https://www.instagram.com/rrayyme/" target="_blank"
            >@rrayyme’s</a
          >
          Instagram account where she records live IGTV workouts. I enjoyed
          these workouts because of the verbal coaching and the variety of
          exercises offered. My favorite kind of workout she does from her
          Instagram is the “54 Card Pickup” series in which every card in a deck
          is attributed to a specific exercise. Red cards are more
          cardio-focused whereas black cards are more strength-focused. I
          recently discovered another YouTuber,
          <a
            class="a"
            href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQJZE_on7It_pEv6tn-jdA"

            >Sydney Cummings</a
          >, who also has tons of effective HIIT workouts and videos targeting
          different areas of the body.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Before this quarantine, I did not work out very frequently, and even
          when I did, it wasn’t structured or frequent. One method that helped
          me stay on track is working out with a partner or a group of friends.
          Scheduling a time to hop on Zoom and workout together is the perfect
          way to hold you and others accountable.

          <!--paragraph-->
          At the end of the day or whenever I am in need of a break, I enjoy
          going onto Netflix or YouTube to unwind. It’s a great way to take your
          mind off of things and even educate yourself in an entertaining way.
          Here are some of the latest shows, movies, and YouTube channels I have
          been watching:

                ><i>Pose</i></a
              >
              (Drama) - This show does an incredible job of displaying the
              emotional depth of the LGBTQ community as well as displaying
              people in the community as “normal people with normal
              problems”<sup>[3]</sup>. I also appreciate how the show cast queer
              people to play queer roles.

              - Recently I’ve been loving watching skincare videos on YouTube
              since it’s so relaxing. If you’re looking for your next cleanser

          <!--paragraph-->
          Reading is a great way to relax and plunge into a new world; it’s a
          chance to escape reality. Aside from the excitement and intrigue that
          reading a book can bring, it’s actually also an effective way to
          reduce stress. According to a 2009 study by the University of Sussex,
          reading for six minutes reduces tension levels by up to 68%!<sup

          If you enjoy thrillers, I highly recommend
          <i>The Woman in the Window </i>by A. J. Finn; I was absolutely hooked
          and was shocked by the end.

          Sleep

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Another fantastic way to practice self-care is to sleep. Naps can be a
          great way to quickly recharge during the day. But besides naps, it’s
          also important to keep a regular sleeping schedule. If you can, try to
          go to sleep a little earlier than usual. You may find yourself waking
          up earlier and feeling more productive about your day. However, there
          is also nothing wrong with allowing yourself to sleep in when you need
          that extra boost of rest.

          by Matt Ragland that detailed how going to bed earlier changed his
          life. Maintaining a healthy and happy lifestyle truly is a cycle. For
          him, exercising caused him to eat better and also become tired around
          bedtime.<sup>[5]</sup> I have also found that regular exercise and
          pushing to improve myself in regard to my physical health has
          increased the quality of my sleep.

          There are many more ways that you can practice self-care, whether it’s
          continuing your passion or experimenting with various side projects.
          At the end of the day, these are just suggestions for ways to practice
          self-care. Self-care is not black and white and there is no one way to
          do it. Here are some more resources for building your own self-care
