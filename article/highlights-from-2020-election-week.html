          Election week has been long and nerve-wracking for many Americans
          including myself. It was filled with constant browser refreshing,
          stress, and surprises. Here are some notable events from this past
          week, aside from the Biden-Harris victory!
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b
              >Cori Bush became the very first Black woman elected to Congress
              in Missouri</b
            >. She is a progressive Democrat, nurse, activist, and single
            mother. On Election Night, Bush stated “As the first Black woman and
            also the first nurse and single mother to have the honor to
            represent Missouri in the United States Congress, let me say this:
            To the Black women, the Black girls, the nurses, the essential
            workers, the single mothers, this is our moment.” In 2014 after the
            shooting of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown, she led protests
            in Ferguson.<sup>[1][2]</sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Ritchie Torres and Mondaire Jones will be the first openly gay
              Black members of Congress</b
            >. Professor Reynolds, a professor at Princeton University’s School
            of Public and International Affairs, stated that Torres and Jones’
            victories represent “a significant moment of psychological change in
            who we feel is electable as a politician.” Congress now has 9 LGBTQ
            members.<sup>[14]</sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Sarah McBride became the first openly trans person elected to the
              state Senate</b
            >, making her the United States’ highest-ranking openly trans
            official. She has focused on LGBTQ equality and has worked at the
            Human Rights Campaign and Equality Delaware. In 2013, McBride pushed
            for the Gender Identity Nondiscrimination Act which ensured equal
            legal protections to trans people in Delaware.<sup>[3][4][7]</sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Every member of “the Squad” was reelected</b>. The members are
            Ayanna Pressley representing Massachusetts District 7, Alexandria
            Ocasio-Cortez representing New York District 14, Rashida Tlaib
            representing Michigan District 13, and Ilhan Omar representing
            Minnesota District 5. These women of color are known for their work
            in progressive issues such as the Green New Deal which addressed
            climate change and economic inequality.<sup>[6]</sup>
          </li>

            <b
              >Michele Rayner-Goolsby became the first openly Black LGBTQ woman
              elected to the Florida House</b
            >.

                Y’all. It just hit me. <br /><br />I’m the first openly Black
                queer women ever elected in Florida-at any level.<br /><br />Our
                team was led by a Black woman. It was anchored by women and
                women of color. We won because we defined ourselves for
                ourselves.<br /><br />Brb- I’m crying now.

            <b>Taylor Small became Vermont’s first openly trans legislator</b>.
            She is the director of the Vermont Pride Center’s Health and
            Wellness program. Small is passionate about supporting the LGBTQ
            community of Vermont and increasing queer and trans visibility.
            She’s also participated in LGBTQ events such as Queen City Drag
            Cabaret and her drag persona name is Nikki Champagne.<sup>[7]</sup>

              >Stephanie Byers became Kansas’s first openly trans state
              lawmaker</b
            >. In 2018, GLSEN (American education organization dedicated to
            ending discrimination against LGBTQ students) named Byers National
            Educator of the Year.<sup>[7][8]</sup>

              state legislature as well as the first non-binary state lawmaker
              in the country</b
            >. The president and CEO for LGBTQ Victory Fund, Annise Parker,
            stated “Mauree is now a trailblazer for non-binary people and their
            courage to run openly will inspire more non-binary people to pursue
            careers in elected office.” Turner has spent her life fighting for
            “immigration rights, racial justice, and criminal justice.”<sup

            Many Americans were
            <b>worried about 300,000 missing mail-in ballots</b>, however an
            article from Vox explains how this was not the case. The President
            of the American Postal Workers Union, Mark Dimondstein, stated that
            “Just because something didn’t have [a delivery scan] does not
            translate at all into ‘it was not delivered.” He explained that the
            ballots were treated with even higher priority than first-class mail
            and were given expedited delivery with the goal of getting the
            ballots mailed in a “quick and efficient” manner.<sup>[5]</sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Nevada became the 1st state in the US to protect gay marriage in
              its constitution</b
            >. The removal of Nevada’s old provision stating that marriage would
            only be recognized between a man and woman means that even if gay
            marriage rights were to change at a federal level, same-sex marriage
            rights would remain protected in Nevada.<sup>[10]</sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            There was an
            <b>unprecedented number of mail-in ballots this year</b>, leading to
            delays in election results. Nevada became a meme for its pace of
            vote-counting. Government officials in Nevada explained that this
            year they are focusing on accuracy over speed. In fact, Pennsylvania
            Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar stated that there was a 10-fold
            increase of mail-in ballots over previous elections.<sup

              >Benjamin L. Ginsberg, called out President Trump’s attempt to to
              prevent voters from being able to vote</b
            >
            in the United States. Ginsberg explains that the Trump campaign did
            not try to “make it easier for citizens to vote”, but instead
            “[sought] to erect barriers.” These barriers Ginsberg discusses
            include “seeking to block state laws to ease voting during the
            pandemic” and “challenging the ballots of individual voters unlikely
            to support him.<sup>[17]</sup>

              >Election night was followed by protesters “demanding a tally of
              all votes in the US election”</b
            >, insisting that the counting of votes stop. These protests arose
            with claims that there were issues with the counting of votes.
            Police arrested over 600 protesters in Minneapolis on Wednesday
            night for “protesting Trump’s threats to challenge the election
            results.” On Thursday morning, Trump supporters gathered outside the
            Phoenix city hall chanting “Protect Our Vote.”<sup>[16]</sup>
