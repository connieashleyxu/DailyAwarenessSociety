          <!--paragraph-->
          Coined in 1931 by historian James Truslow Adams in his book “Epic of
          America,” the American dream is an idea that the majority of Americans
          still believe in. But, according to a poll done by Gallup, the amount
          of Americans who believe the American dream is dwindling, and for good
          reason too.<sup>[2]</sup>

          Let’s analyze the definition of “the American dream” as provided by
          the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. The first word that stands out to me
          is the word “anyone.” Immediately, a couple of questions come to mind:
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          1) How feasible is it for <i>anyone</i> to be living the American
          dream?<br />
          2) At this time, is the American dream just a facade?
        </p>

          In the U.S., only 3% of the population has a net worth of $1
          million.<sup>[3]</sup> This statistic begs the question, why is that
          percentage not greater if anyone can achieve the American dream and
          gain wealth by just working hard?
        </p>

          It’s no secret that privilege and luck plays a huge part in achieving

          education, and age.<sup>[4]</sup> The article and quiz only provide a
          probability for a select amount of races (White, Asian, Black, and
          Hispanic) due to the limited information received from research
          results.

          It’s no secret that becoming a millionaire is difficult, so most
          percentages are rather low. Did you think the percentages you received
          were “fair”? Let’s take compare the percentages with one another

          In the quiz, there were a total of 60 results that one may receive

          <!--paragraph-->

          But, it is clear systemic racism still plagues the US. While we are
          hearing more voices in the media about these deep-rooted issues, we
          aren’t seeing enough changes to make a lasting impact.

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          The American dream doesn’t have to be a facade if we take reformative
