          Acne is annoying and almost everyone I know has struggled with it at
          some point in their life. It can be frustrating and confusing to
          treat, due to the abundance of skincare information there is on the
          internet. I have personally struggled with acne for many years and
          continue to struggle with it. Because my skin is not perfect, I have
          watched many many YouTube videos and tested many different acne
          treatments myself. Before diving into acne treatment products, it’s
          important to understand the basics of skincare. Check out our skincare
          basics article

          There are many different kinds of acne treatments on the market. Some
          need to be prescribed, some don’t. Some are cheap and some are
          expensive. Some are extremely gentle, and others could have intense
          side effects such as drying of the skin or purging. With all skincare,
          it’s incredibly important to listen to your skin and be gentle. Be
          gentle with how you interact with your skin and be gentle with the
          products you apply.

          Today, I will be covering a few acne-treatment ingredients: AHAs,
          BHAs, and Retinoids. Here are some important precautions to take with
          acne treatments and skincare in general:
        </p>

        <ul class="paragraph">
          <li>
            Always start out slow when introducing a new treatment product. You
            can do this by:
            <ul class="paragraph">
              <li>using your new product once a week</li>
              <li>
                using moisturizer as a buffer (apply moisturizer first, then
                your treatment)
              </li>
              <li>combine your treatment with your moisturizer</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure to apply acne treatment products on dry skin (after you
            cleanse). Damp skin may cause your acne treatment to penetrate
            deeper into the skin, increasing your chances of skin irritation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure to apply sunscreen daily! Treatments can leave the skin
            more prone to sun damage. Even if you do not use treatments, using a
            sunscreen every day is beneficial for anti-aging and skin cancer
            prevention.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treatments take time. Give your products a chance to work! Check out
            Mixed Makeup’s video
            <a class="a" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OtFuKShv3Y4"
              >here</a
            >
            for detailed information on how long it should take for your
            products to work. Typically, you should give your products at least
            2-3 months to show improvement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be cautious of over-using your treatment and potentially receiving a
            bad reaction from a new product. Everyone’s skin is unique so it is
            important to pay attention to how your skin reacts. Patch testing is
            a good way to gauge how your skin reacts to new products. To patch
            test, apply the product to a small area on your skin for a few
            days/applications.<sup>[1]</sup>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Now let’s jump into some treatment ingredients! Chemical exfoliants
          such as AHAs and BHAs help to exfoliate dead skin cells on the surface
          of the skin. They help reveal fresh, new skin and can help with acne
          and texture.<sup>[2]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          <strong><center>Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs)</center></strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Alpha hydroxy acids or AHAs are chemical exfoliants that help to
          exfoliate dead skin cells on the surface of the skin. Between AHAs and
          BHAs, AHAs are gentler and not oil-soluble. AHAs work more towards the
          surface of the skin than BHAs; they do not penetrate as deeply as
          BHAs. Some AHAs include glycolic acid, mandelic acid, and lactic acid.
          Here’s some information on these ingredients, as explained by
          KraveBeauty:

        />

        <p class="paragraph">
          Here is a great AHA for both beginners and skincare gurus:

            >KraveBeauty Kale-Lalu-yAHA ($25)</a
          >
          - This is a great chemical exfoliant that contains 5.25% glycolic acid
          and other skin-restoring ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, spinach,
          parsley, and more. It is incredibly gentle and hydrating for a
          chemical exfoliant.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Beta hydroxy acids or BHAs are also chemical exfoliants; however, they
          are oil-soluble and penetrate deeper into the skin than AHAs.<sup
            >[3]</sup
          >
          When used properly, BHAs can be great for unclogging pores and helping
          reduce acne. The most common BHA used is salicylic acid. Here are some
          fantastic salicylic acid products:

          <strong><center>Retinoids</center></strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Retinoids are a common ingredient used to combat hyperpigmentation,
          skin texture, acne, and anti-aging! Some over-the-counter retinoids
          which you can buy without a prescription include retinol,
          retinaldehyde, retinyl esters, and granactive retinoids.
          Over-the-counter retinoids go through a conversion process that
          converts them into retinoic acid. This conversion process is what
          makes over-the-counter retinoids gentler than prescription strengths
          retinoids such as tretinoin. Nonetheless, all retinoid types can be
          powerful and effective in combatting acne issues. For more information
          on retinoids, watch Mixed Makeup’s video on the different kinds

            >
            - This is a great, non-irritating retinol cream/moisturizer that I
            personally have enjoyed using on top of my normal moisturizer
            (CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion).

              >Differin Gel ($12.89)</a
            >
            - This is a retinol product that uses 0.1% adapalene. Adapalene was
            actually approved to be offered over the counter rather than as a
            prescription and is commonly recommended for acne. For tips on using
            Differin check out Dr. Dray’s video

              >Ok, now I know about these different kinds of acne treatments.
              Which one do I choose?</i
            ></b
          ><br />I recommend starting out with an AHA or BHA product. If your
          skin is very sensitive, I would say try the Krave AHA chemical
          exfoliant. Otherwise, feel free to try out an AHA or BHA product. The
          most important advice I can give is to not over-do it! When I first
          started using a BHA exfoliant, I made the mistake of using it every
          single night. This actually made my skin worse and much more
          irritated. If you have already tried AHA/BHA products and want to try
          something else, retinol is a great option for you. With all
          treatments, I personally believe it is much more beneficial to stick
          with 1 product rather than to use a bunch of different products and
          not know what is actually helping or hurting your skin.

          <strong><center>Alternative Option: Skincare Reset</center></strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          If you have felt like you have tried everything possible (I felt
          this), making a skincare reset might be ur best option. Bring it back
          to the basics: cleanse, moisturize, apply SPF. Do this for a few weeks
          or even months and see how your skin feels. Use this time to heal your
          skin with hydrating, rich ingredients. This helped me a lot after
          over-using chemical exfoliants!
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Good luck and remember that skincare is a journey! Looking forward to
          your skin glow-up. :D
