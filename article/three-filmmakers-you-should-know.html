          <strong>AVA DUVERNAY</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          If you’ve been on Instagram at all in the past few months amidst an
          outpouring of posts about social change, you’ve probably heard of the
          Netflix documentary 13th (2016), a groundbreaking film that explores
          the issue of systemic racism in America, the era of mass
          incarceration, the prison-industrial complex, and the evolution of
          slavery. You’ve probably heard of When They See Us (2019), another
          Netflix docuseries that follows the lives of the Central Park Five, a
          group of teens of color who were wrongfully convicted of rape and
          assault. But what you might not know is that these two films were the
          brainchildren of the same filmmaker: Ava DuVernay.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          A writer, producer, director, and distributor of independent film,
          DuVernay is critically acclaimed and historically relevant. She was
          the first black woman to be nominated for a Golden Globe for Best
          Director for Selma (2014), and she is the highest grossing black woman
          director in American box office history, made possible by her work on
          Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time (2018). Her films are gripping, empowering,
          revolutionary, and beautifully made; they tackle issues of race,
          class, and power and have transformed the conversations I’ve been
          having recently about the current state of America. DuVernay’s work
          resonates strongly with me as someone avidly curious about politics
          and social change, but also as an appreciator of cinematography,
          aesthetics, and production. I highly recommend looking into her work,
          and I’m currently making my way through her filmography!

          <strong>WES ANDERSON</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Very few filmmakers have mastered the ability to create their own
          distinct style — one that is instantly recognizable from just a
          singular shot — like Wes Anderson; in fact, his unique approach has
          even been deemed the "Wes Anderson style" of movie-making, intensely
          studied by film students and appreciators alike. Of his filmography,
          Moonrise Kingdom (2012) and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) are
          personal favorites (although I still haven’t seen all of them), not
          only for their aesthetics but also for their writing. Wes Anderson's
          movies are visually, aesthetically, and cinematically pleasing. Some
          of his easily recognizable trademarks include the use of symmetry,
          pastel colors, and profile shots of his actors and actresses. SC
          Lannom writes in StudioBinder's "The Wes Anderson Style Explained"
          that his "aesthetic is much more deliberate [than what initially meets
          the eye]. It seems simple, but it's complex. The viewer gets to enjoy
          a sophisticated film that spoon-feeds information. His stories are
          undeniably fun, and he is one of the only working directors who can
          pull off massive tonal shifts." <sup>[1]</sup> He is regarded by some
          as the modern-day version of the auteur, a filmmaker or director with
          a recognizable style or thematic preoccupation.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          It's also important to note that Wes Anderson isn't a cinematographer
          but a director; the credit for all of his iconic shots should be given
          to Robert Yeoman, the sole cinematographer Anderson has worked with
          for all of his live-action films. As Lannom describes in the article,
          "Anderson and Yeoman often present images in symmetrical, flat
          compositions. This furthers the 'storybook motif' that Anderson aims
          to create with his visuals. Viewers feel like they are moving through
          some sort of doll house world. The imagery in Wes Anderson films can
          be light and fluffy, but it's presented in a direct, succinct, and
          precise manner. This gives it style and weight." Wes Anderson is truly
          a movie-making genius, and I highly recommend following his work.
          (He's also a UT alum!)

          <strong>JORDAN PEELE</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Many knew him from his sketch comedy series Key and Peele, but most
          know him now from his critically acclaimed filmography, which includes
          Get Out (2017), BlacKkKlansman (2018), and Us (2019). Jordan Peele,
          the mastermind of horror and comedy, must also be included in this
          week’s spotlight.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Peele has only been in the world of directing and producing for a few
          years (although he acted and starred in several TV series years
          earlier), making his success and talent as a relatively new filmmaker
          all the more impressive. Get Out, his directorial debut, received
          immense praise, nominations, and awards (as it deserved); it scored a
          98% on Rotten Tomatoes and was nominated for Best Picture, Best
          Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor at the Oscars.
          Peele has a unique ability to seamlessly tie in themes of race, class,
          culture, and comedy into his horror films, leaving his audience
          Googling the plot after the movie has ended in wonder and shock. The
          Independent writes that "[m]ixing horror and comedy is hardly a new
          idea, but there are few directors who can so thoroughly entertain an
          audience while also delivering layered, nuanced social commentary –
          the kind that keeps people talking long after the screams subside."
          These nuances — which primarily comment on the state of America and
          the role of race, whiteness, and blackness — are laced throughout his
          films; an example is The Sunken Place in Get Out, whose "metaphorical
          meaning [is] commonly used now to describe black individuals who
          appear to be willingly upholding and promoting racist constructs and
          ideologies." <sup>[2]</sup> I love dissecting, analyzing, and reading
          about these concepts afterwards, because they're incredibly complex,
          more than they initially seem. In an interview about Us (2019), Peele
          said, "We are our own worst enemy. Not just as individuals but more
          importantly as a group, as a family, as a society, as a country, as a
          world. We are afraid of the shadowy, mysterious ‘other’ that’s gonna
          come and kill us and take our jobs... no one’s taking responsibility
          for where we’re at." As a director and storyteller, Peele has mastered
          the art of manipulating his audiences as each element of the plot
          unfolds, while simultaneously challenging their preconceived notions
          of the world.
