          Take a moment to recollect and savor your childhood memories -- those
          blissful moments when we were so carefree, so unbothered, so
          <i>oblivious</i>. Remember your favorite bedtime stories? Do authors
          like Dr. Seuss and Roald Dahl ring a bell? Maybe you can even remember
          the moments your parents read aloud your favorite book as you drifted
          off to sleep.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          For me, my bedtime stories weren’t your typical “Oh, the Places You’ll
          Go,” but rather memories my parents relived as they retold their
          childhood stories during the Cultural Revolution. I loved hearing
          their accounts -- it brought me closer to my Chinese background, but I
          didn't realize it back then. I remember thinking that their realities
          seemed more like fantasies as I never thought to actually put myself
          in their shoes.
        </p>
        <div class="blockQuote">
          <blockquote class="quote">
            “Soldiers rushed into our house one day and inspected every corner.
            The next day, 3 families that we had never met before moved in.”
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="quote">
            “There was this beautiful young lady who had a little bit of a limp.
            The boys would kick her until she fell onto the cement. No one would
            ever help her because we were so terrified of the ruthless boys.”
          </blockquote>

        <p class="paragraph">
          It wasn’t until high school that I learned about the Cultural
          Revolution in my AP World History class. I had spent 9 out of my 12
          years of education relearning the same bulk of American History that
          we had already been taught throughout elementary school.
        </p>

            would not have the luxury of being here today.”

        <p class="paragraph">
          In all the 12 years of my education, my history courses were taught by
          white people with textbooks written by white people. Because the
          sources of my historical education were taught by those who have never
          experienced racism in the U.S., the amount of bias and skew placed on
          every history lesson was unnatural.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Flash forward to the present time, the issue of institutional racism
          is being amplified yet again. But, what long-term changes are we
          really seeing?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Not much. One of the many roots that fuel this mentality of degrading
          POCs in the U.S. starts with our education system.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Remember seeing textbook pictures of labels that designated what
          public utility people could use based on if they were “white” or
          “colored”? Remember the eerie images of the men hiding behind white
          hoods and gowns as they found their next murder victims just because
          they were black? These images hold very vivid memories for me** -- I
          was so disgusted that such blatant racism could be tolerated. I was
          led to believe that these things could never happen now because we
          recognize the negative impacts of segregation. After all, we learned
          that the government system we have today outlaws these horrid acts,
          right?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Not exactly. The sad reality is that there are just reiterations in
          our government to keep POCs, especially blacks, oppressed. Remember
          learning that the only American citizens who cannot vote are felons?
          What our educational system failed to teach us is that blacks are
          disproportionately targeted for crime. In other words, the ratio of
          black felons is greater than any other race.<sup>[1][2]</sup>
          Connecting the dots, with more blacks charged as felons, politicians
          are able to legally keep blacks from voting. With less representation
          at the polls, the cycle of systemic racism will persist.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Wholistically speaking, when our educational system fails to depict
          accurate representations of minorities and cultures outside the
          Eurocentric ideal, children cannot learn to understand and appreciate
          other customs. If we grow up only knowing “white” culture and we are
          shamed for looking different, whether it may be the color of our skin
          or the shape of our eyes, we are conditioned to believe westernized
          culture is superior.<sup>[3]</sup> This notion funnels the abasement
          of people who don’t fall into that classic 1950s White American ideal,
          which only perpetuates racism.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Only after committing to digging deeper into documentation and papers
          outside of school, have I realized that our education system ensures
          that we turn a blind eye to all the problems within our society that
          have never genuinely changed since the creation of the United States
          of America. That oblivion facilitated to us as young minds may not be
          so blissful if we were taught to take a step back and really simmer on
          the corruption bred into our society from the day we enter the
          education system at age 5.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          While I recognize scrapping the entire educational system and
          rebuilding it from scratch is an unrealistic short-term goal, there
          are baby steps we can take to reform U.S. education. Advocating for
          diversity amongst the student population as well as the teacher
          population should be the first step we take*. Diversity will bring the
          ability to grasp different perspectives of history and culture to our
          education system. By building such environment, we can stop the cycle
          of breeding institutional racism to young and susceptible minds. Only
          then will we be able to see a glimpse of a future where all of our
          children are raised to be compassionate and genuinely educated
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Take a moment to imagine that future -- one where the social
          constructs of race are mitigated. It’s almost impossible to visualize
          this future without picturing some fictional utopia, and that is
          perhaps what is the most haunting.
