        <p class="paragraph">
          January 6, 2021 started off as a normal day for many. Jon Ossoff and
          Reverend Raphael Warnock were just declared winners of the
          Georgia Senate runoffs, allowing Democrats to take control of the
          Senate, House, and White House. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West just
          announced their plans to divorce, and Congress started certifying
          President-Elect Biden’s victory. Yet, that afternoon, ardent Trump
          supporters raided the Capitol Building in order to overturn the
          results of the 2020 presidential election, transpiring hours of
          lockdown, chaos, and nationwide shock. Four days later, the events of
          that afternoon are still quite surreal to me, in particular how the
          current Trump administration and Capitol Police were so complacent to
          it. Let’s break down the aftermath of Tuesday afternoon.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>An early ending to Trump’s Presidency? </strong> <br />
            As of today, 2 of Trump’s Cabinet members (Betsy Devos and Elaine
            Chao) and other White House aides like Mick Mulvaney have resigned
            from office. Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms
            have also indefinitely suspended Trump’s accounts. However, the left
            has been pushing for big tech to take more action on Trump’s social
            media behaviors since the start of his term. This delayed move may
            just be big tech trying to get on Democrats’ good side after the
            party seized control of the Senate. As the country transitions into
            a Democrat-majority House and Senate, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has
            stated that the House is ready to impeach Trump if Vice President
            Pence does not invoke the 25th amendment, which would allow Pence to become President until Biden's inauguration. Senators and
            Representatives such as Ted Lieu, Cori Bush, AOC, and Bernie Sanders are
            also pushing to remove representatives who promoted election fraud.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Conflicts within the GOP</strong><br />
            Following Tuesday’s riots, many Republican members of Congress who
            originally planned to dispute election results switched their
            stances on the topic (Ex: Kelly Loeffler). After members of Congress
            were barricaded in Capitol Hill for several hours, the certification
            process was even expedited, and notable members of the GOP such as
            Mitch McConnell and Mike Pence have recognized Biden’s victory for
            the first time since November. The narrative of election fraud
            spread by Trump could have potentially cost Republicans to lose
            their seats in Georgia during the runoff, instigating a divide
            between traditional Republicans and die-hard Trump supporters. Vice
            President Pence, for example, has started to reject pressure from
            Trump to continue spreading the narrative of election fraud, causing
            him to receive backlash from right-wing extremists.

            <strong>Rethinking the Social Dilemma (again)</strong> <br />
            A few months ago, DAS published an article about the Netflix
            documentary <em>The Social Dilemma</em>
            <a
              target="blank"
              href="/article/rethinking-social-media-&-the-social-dilemma.html"
              >here</a
            >. Over the past couple months after watching the film, I’ve been
            noticing standoffs between Trump supporters and Democrats being
            recorded by both sides. Personally, my social feed has always leaned
            towards one side of the political spectrum, but I have wondered if
            the responses I see in the comment are similar on the other side.
            How out of touch am I from other political perspectives? Facebook
            and Twitter’s suspension of Trump’s accounts are only a start to
            moderating the fake news plaguing the Internet. While Trump and
            other Republican representatives and senators instigated the riot,
            far-right accounts on Parler or 4chan are much more harmful and grow
            the fire.

            <strong>Raising attention towards US imperialism worldwide</strong>
            <br />
            While this was the first riot Americans have ever seen at the
            Capitol since the War of 1812, riots like these happen
            internationally, and they’re backed by our own country. History
            textbooks often glorify coups, which include overthrowing Nazi
            Germany and imperial Japan. However, much of the US’s attempts to
            change non-democratic regimes are not for human rights but rather to
            promote business interests or tap into natural resources, and both
            political parties in the US have supported coups worldwide.
            Currently, the US is heavily involved in Latin America, from
            Venezuela to Bolivia. In 2019, the US backed a 21-day political coup
            in Bolivia, leading to 33 deaths and 315 injuries, in order to take
            over the socialistic Bolivian government. We only saw a dumbed-down
            version of what this country enables in other places.

            <strong>Recognizing how prevalent white supremacy is</strong> <br />
            In the past, I’ve always thought of members of groups like the Proud
            Boys and KKK to be white supremacists. Yet, Trump’s presidency has
            enabled a widespread complacency to white supremacy. Trump refused
            to condemn white supremacist groups at the presidential debate,
            instead telling them the Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by.'
            After the riot, he still refused to call the National Guard and told
            rioters that they were valued and loved. The fact that there were
            still millions of people who voted for him is an indication that
            people condone his actions. The problem is not just limited to the
            President though. November’s election brought QAnon believers and
            neo-nazis to the House of Representatives. Videos showing some
            Capitol Police officers literally letting the gates open to rioters
            and posing selfies with them while government officials like Ted
            Cruz and Josh Hawley still promote the election fraud myth shows how
            some Americans find these behaviors acceptable. The fact that a
            country that prides itself on the stories of immigrants allows white
            supremacist behavior to hold government power is not okay.
