          <!--paragraph-->
          My summer break quarantine was very relaxing and chill. I watched a
          lot of TV, had many FaceTime calls, and built Minecraft houses with my
          friends. But now that college has started, I had to quickly do a full
          180 and figure out how to get back in the school grind. This seemed
          pretty difficult, especially after having a seemingly 6-month-long
          break. However, the transition hasn’t been too bad so far.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          In this article, I will be providing notes on key ways that I have
          kept myself productive and apps that I have found incredibly helpful
          with this process. Even though productivity is a great feeling and
          something we strive for throughout our school and work life, it’s
          important to also tackle the issues that can arise with feeling
          unproductive. We’ve definitely all had moments in which we felt guilty
          for having fun or taking rest. I’ve realized that many societal
          pressures can cause these feelings and that we don’t need to feel this
          way if we just reshape our views on what productivity truly means.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          One important difference to understand is that productivity and being
          busy do not mean the same thing. As author Hannah Braime said on a
          post on <i>Becoming Who You Are</i>:
        </p>

        <div class="blockQuote">
          <blockquote class="quote">
            “[W]e want to detach from busy-ness for the sake of being busy. An
            activity or pursuit is only productive if it’s actually adding
            something to our lives.”
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          She also detailed the need to change how we look at rest. Taking
          moments to rest, have fun, or recharge help to create balance in life.
          Another great point that Braime makes is that self-worth needs to be
          changed from a condition to a value<sup>[1]</sup>.
        </p>

        <div class="blockQuote">
          <blockquote class="quote">
            “[D]eepening our sense of self-worth becomes easier when we hold
            self-worth as a value, not as the result of something conditional.”
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="quote">
            “The things we do as a result of valuing our self-worth might be
            similar, but the energy behind them is quite different. It’s
            avoiding pain (in this case, the pain of not feeling worthy) versus
            seeking growth (starting from a place of having self-worth as a key
            value).”
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Now that we have clarified what productivity really means, here are
          some key changes that I have integrated into my daily life to keep
          myself on track in school and in life:
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          <strong>1. Clean Working Environment</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          I revamped both my working environment and my bedroom since, together,
          they were going to be my “dorm” for the next half year. It is
          important to create a workspace and living space that you feel happy
          in. I installed a new desk, got a new monitor, and a succulent for
          some added greenery. In my bedroom, I did some decorating by ordering
          some photos and printing some posters off of FedEx. Especially during
          a time like now where we are staying at home much more, I recommend
          making your living space look and feel however you want to. Now is the
          perfect time to spend some time creating an environment that you enjoy
          living and working in.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Once you have created your own personal workspace, I recommend keeping
          it clean and tidy. Having a busy school schedule can be stressful
          enough, so I have found that making sure I go to sleep with my
          workspace ready for the next day is helpful with setting a fresh,
          productive mood for the morning.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          <strong>2. Compartmentalization</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          One way that I’ve been keeping myself focused on my work is by
          compartmentalizing my work life and personal life within my house.
          Normally, I would be doing that by calling my dorm my personal space
          and the libraries around campus my working space. However, given the
          current circumstances and the fact that I am staying home this
          semester, I have dedicated one room for work and one room for
          relaxation.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          To keep yourself focused, you could also put your phone in a different
          room and turn on “Do Not Disturb” on your devices to prevent yourself
          from getting distracted when you want to get work done.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          <strong>3. Give Yourself Breaks</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Another key component of productivity is non-productivity, well to a
          certain extent :P. It’s important to give yourself small breaks here
          and there so that you don’t burn out or become overwhelmed. You could
          take a walk, go work out, call a friend, etc. Feel free to check out

          Now that we have covered some fundamental principles to becoming and
          staying productive, here are some apps that I have found incredibly
          useful for planning and keeping track of everything in my life:

            This is an app that I discovered shortly before college started and
            wow it made me excited. Notion is an app that you can use for
            planning, making to-do lists, note-taking, journaling, and more. The
            great thing about Notion is that there is so much that you can
            customize and people all over the internet have designed templates
            that you can use based on your needs. I have been using Notion for
            so many aspects of my life. Here are some of the pages that I have
            made so far:
          </p>
          <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>
              <u>Weekly Plan</u> - I go here every day to schedule what tasks I
              need to complete for the day. I also created a template button so
              that I can easily prepare for a new week of todos.
            </li>

            <li>
              <u>Master Schedule and Class Pages</u> (<a
                href="https://www.notion.so/Degree-Name-7155be3c3f234c1298577b183ba183f8"
                target="_blank"
                >template</a
              >)
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <u>Master Schedule</u> - This is where I store all of the
                  tasks that I have. Once I received my syllabi, I put all of my
                  homework, quizzes, and exams into this page. I have this page
                  in a table format in which I can see which class my tasks are
                  for, when they are due, and any notes that I may have on the
                  assignments.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The great thing about Notion is that you can also display
                      tables in various “views”. This means that you can use
                      this table to view all your tasks at once or to filter
                      what you see to a specific class.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Class Pages</u> - These are pages that I have created for
                  each of the classes that I am taking this semester. Inside
                  each specific class page, I put my instructor contact
                  information, specific notes for each course, links to relevant
                  websites, and a table for lecture notes. Here are some tips
                  for using Notion for your class notes:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Use toggles instead of bullet points when taking notes
                      that you may want to create flashcards for. You can simply
                      use toggles to display and hide information in a similar
                      way to flashcards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If you are taking a course involving code, use code blocks
                      to have your code automatically styled as if you were
                      working in a programming editor.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  />
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <u>Journal</u> - For this page, I created a column to hold my
              recent journal entries and a column listing archive pages for each
              month.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Aside from these pages, I have also created pages for any side
          projects that I want to pursue and just any thoughts that I may have.
          You can use Notion for anything you want. The ability to design your
          pages in any way you want is what makes Notion stand apart from other
          planning and note-taking platforms. It truly is the
          all-in-one-workspace!

          I’m sure everyone has heard of Google Calendar but I just wanted to
          include this app in this article since it is an integral part of my
          workflow. The only apps I use to schedule and keep track of my tasks
          are Notion and Google Calendar. Google Calendar is a fantastic app
          that keeps a record of upcoming events and helps plan out your day.
          It’s also visually simple and appealing to use.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          I typically put my Notion and Google Calendar windows side by side and
          plan out my day, blocking out times for different tasks, meals, and
          workouts. By doing this either the night before or the morning of, you
          can keep yourself on track and always know what you need to be doing.
          I’ve created separate calendars with different colors for my classes,
          assessments, career, office hours, personal, RSOs, social, and work. I
          have found that using this method of calendar blocking helps reduce
          the amount of time I spend wondering what I need to do during the day.
          Here is a great video on calendar blocking: “<a

            GoodNotes is an app that I have been using for high school and now
            for college. If you have an iPad with an Apple Pencil this app is
            incredibly useful for taking class notes. You can create notebooks
            and quick notes and categorize them into folders for organization. I
            love how simple and easy-to-use the interface is. Here are some of
            my favorite features of GoodNotes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <u>Photo Importing</u> - GoodNotes makes importing photos super
              smooth because you’re able to preview all your recently taken
              photos in the toolbar. It’s a super-fast 2-tap process when you
              are taking notes and doesn’t slow you down.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Document Importing</u> - This semester I am taking 2 math
              courses and my professors have provided fill-in PDF worksheets to
              use during the lectures. I love how I’m able to AirDrop my
              downloaded PDF worksheets to my iPad and import them inside my
              math notebooks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Search Through Notes</u> - The search tool is particularly
              useful when studying and wanting to immediately find a certain
              topic in your notes. Being able to search not only through typed
              text but also handwritten text can be helpful when grinding before
              a quiz or exam.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          I hope my dive into the various ways I try to maintain productivity
          and efficiency and the apps that I mentioned will help you with
          managing your time, tasks, and life. Even though working hard is an
          amazing feeling, never forget to separate your self-worth from your
          work and allow yourself time to rest. To enjoy life is neither selfish
          nor unproductive, but the whole point of living life.
