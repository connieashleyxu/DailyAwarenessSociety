          Recently, I watched the new Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma.
          Working with former tech executives to close the knowledge gap between
          AI and the general public, the documentary calls society to rethink
          their technology usage and abolish the business models that
          capitalizes off of tech's negative impacts.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Ironically, I initially heard about the film through AI algorithms and
          social media. While I was watching another show on Netflix, the
          recommendation for this show popped up on my screen. Shortly after, my
          friends had shared it with me via Facebook Messenger. Technology
          appears in every aspect of our lives. As I was watching the film, this
          statement proved itself over and over again.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          In the tech industry, companies have specific teams allocated for
          growth marketing. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Linkedin --
          you name it. The purpose of growth is undoubtedly profit. When
          businesses start, it’s imperative to include in their model potential
          revenue streams, and this goes the same for established corporations
          as well. Though social media services are free for us consumers to
          download, they are the wealthiest companies to ever exist in history.
          Alphabet, the parent company of Google and Youtube, was worth 859.2
          billion dollars in 2019. Facebook was worth 511.35
          billion<sup>[1]</sup>. But how do these companies make so much when
          they aren’t even selling directly to the consumer? Because growth
          professionals market the very thing that is precious to all of us:
          time.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I’ve heard the sayings “time is precious” and “the only thing you
          can’t buy is time” since I was a kid. Yet, big tech has found the way
          to monetize our time. Likes, comments, photo tagging. When we see the
          notification that “someone tagged you in a photo,” we are inclined to
          click on it and see what we’ve been tagged in. Once we click on it,
          Facebook, Instagram, etc. now have control over our time, which
          advertisers will bid for and buy. This is a never ending cycle for the
          3.8 billion users on social media<sup>[2]</sup>, and there is no
          restraint to what is being sold. There could be an ad promoting that
          climate change is a hoax on one person’s screen or an ad promoting
          conspiracy theories like Pizzagate on another’s; there is no
          distinction between fact and fiction. Technology discovering a way to
          control our time is just a step to exploring what else they can
          control, such as our political beliefs. Naturally, we develop our
          ideologies through the information we are presented with, but because
          social media has the power to personalize our information the way we
          like it, they can skew our beliefs one way or another. As a result,
          America’s social fabric is becoming more polarized every single
          day<sup>[3]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Another big takeaway I got from the documentary was the idea that
          “nobody really knows what they are doing.” I remember being told this
          frequently when I attended talks from leading figures in different
          professional fields. The phrase is commonly used as a way to mitigate
          imposter syndrome, and I thought that this was a good thing. I don’t
          really know what I’m doing right now, but no one does either. However,
          I find it a bit concerning that the AI engineers have a high chance of
          not knowing what they are doing either. In the documentary, the
          creator of the Facebook like button never estimated that it would be
          used as a superficial measure of popularity that could spark
          depression and eating disorders. These creations are way too prevalent
          for designers to not fully understand, and this is a perfect example
          of why STEM is intertwined with humanities. Those in STEM must think
          about the impact of their creations before release.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          As I am writing this article, I know that DAS will promote it through
          social media. Even more ironic is the fact that shortly after I
          watched that documentary, I returned quickly back to social media to
          share my thoughts with my friends. Software is so ingrained into our
          lifestyle that I can’t imagine life without it. But there exists a
          negative side to tech that engineers and non-engineers must both
          consider. Not all technology is inherently bad. Rather, it’s how we
          use it and the economic models that propagate the toxic usage of it.
          What I found most frightening about this documentary was that even
          though I knew the animations and storyline were being exaggerated, I
          could picture all of it happening in reality. We must reframe our
          usage and take down the markets that enable its toxicity now more than
          ever.

            Rethink your social media usage. It’s okay to unfollow those who you
            don’t want to follow. Your account should be a safe and happy space
            for you to post and see whatever you want.
