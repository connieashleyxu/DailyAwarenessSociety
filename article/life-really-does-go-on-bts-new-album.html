          You may have heard of the “the biggest boy band in the world” or, as
          they’ve recently been named, Wall Street Journal’s 2020 Music
          Innovator: BTS.<sup>[1]</sup>
        </p>

          BTS holds the “Guinness World Record for staging the biggest virtually
          attended livestream music performance, which attracted fans from over
          100 countries."<sup>[2]</sup> They’ve also often been referred to as
          “the Beatles of the 21st century."<sup>[3]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          But what makes BTS so special is their connection with their fans,
          named A.R.M.Y. (which stands for Adorable Representative MC for
          Youth), through the topics that their music is about. Their songs have
          covered topics from bullying, mental health, and even topics that are
          taboo within the South Korean government.<sup>[4]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Their ability to relate and connect with their fans has continued
          through their most recent comeback with their new album “BE” and music
          video “Life Goes On.” What makes this album and comeback even more
          special is the BTS members’ direct involvement in the production,
          design, and direction of the music. As their label has said, “This
          album is made more special by direct involvement from BTS in not only
          the music, but from the concept and composition to design. You will
          discover throughout the album the thoughts, emotions and deepest
          reflections of BTS while experiencing an even richer musical
          spectrum”.<sup>[5]</sup> The music video was even directed by Jeon
          Jung-Kook, BTS’ youngest member.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          “Life Goes On” is the title track for their new album, touching on the
          fact that “‘even in the face of this new normality, our life goes on’
          and imparts a message of healing to fans and to the world.”<sup

          The official “Life Goes On” music video “earned a preliminary 68
          million YouTube views in its first 24 hours,” making it “one of the
          top 5 biggest debuts ever” on Youtube.<sup>[7]</sup> Despite this, as
          of 11:52 AM CST, November 22, “Life Goes On” has only had 61 total
          spins on US pop radio as journalist Brian Patrick Byrne has
          reported.<sup>[8]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          This is not the first time that BTS has faced discriminiation in the
          Western media scene. Their music video views are always deleted by
          Youtube and are never given the proper recognition at American award
          shows, with the creation of separate categories such as “K-pop."<sup
            >[9][10]</sup
          >
          This comes despite the fact that white Canadian singers and white
          British boy-groups can be nominated for main awards at American award
          shows, but a Korean boy group is moved into a separate category.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Really, despite all this, BTS has continued to stay positive and
          optimistic, serving as the young generation’s role model by partnering
          with UNICEF on the ‘Love Myself’ campaign, starting in 2017. This
          global UNICEF campaign “aimed at the protection of young people so
          they can live without the fear of violence, and promotes the hashtag –
          #BTSLoveMyself, which asks fans and supporters to post self-loving
          photos with the hashtag to different social media platforms”.<sup
            >[11]</sup
          >
          The proceeds of this campaign are “used to support young victims of
          school violence, domestic violence and sexual assault around the
          world, as well as education programs for local communities to aid
          violence prevention."<sup>[12]</sup> This campaign has raised
          approximately $2.8 million USD as of October 2020.<sup>[13]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Not only has BTS collaborated with UNICEF, they have spoken at the
          73rd and 75th United Nations General Assembly in 2018 and 2020,
          respectively. Their most recent appearance at the 75th United Nations
          this past September gave them the platform to speak on loving oneself
          and supporting one another during this hard time, previewing their new
          song “Life Goes On” by ending the speech with “Life goes on. Let’s
          live on."<sup>[14][15]</sup>
