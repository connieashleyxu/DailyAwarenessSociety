          According to dictionary.com, education is the process of imparting or
          acquiring general knowledge. Developing the power of reasoning and
          judgement. Preparing oneself intellectually for mature life. According
          to the second definition that pops up on Google, it’s an enlightening
          experience. (If these definitions don’t scream “liberation,” I don’t
          know what does.) We’ve all heard or seen the statistics on higher
          education: college graduates with a bachelor’s degree typically earn
          66% more and are far less likely to face unemployment than those with
          just a high school diploma.<sup>[1]</sup> And if you’re reading this,
          you’re most likely in school, either applying for college or currently
          attending one, so some part of you probably believes that it’s
          worthwhile to get an education. And I’m just like you, someone who
          made my way through the K-12 system and is now taking on a four-year
          university, all in hopes of landing a stable and secure job that will
          let me live comfortably for the rest of my life. But through this
          lifelong, sometimes (edit: most of the time) stressful process, are we
          truly liberating ourselves and becoming enlightened, better people?
          Are we developing the skills to combat all of the structural -isms in
          the world, to think critically, and to equip ourselves to create a
          better tomorrow?

          Brazilian philosopher Paulo Freire argues that we aren’t. Or at least,
          not in the way that we should be. In his 1968 book “Pedagogy of the
          Oppressed,” he discusses the “banking model of education,” in which
          the teacher is the epistemological source of authority and the
          students are passive, empty vessels, patiently waiting to store
          information passed down from their teachers. In this traditional
          Western model, Freire argues that students’ pre-existing knowledge is
          ignored and that their sole responsibility is to remember and recall
          the information provided to them. The world is “static and
          unchangeable, and students are simply supposed to fit into it as it
          is”.<sup>[2]</sup> If any of this sounds familiar to you, which it
          definitely does to me (see: AP Human Geography, or honestly any AP
          class in general), then you probably know how monotonous it can feel.
          Coupled with a culture of toxic competition that results in students
          dropping fine arts electives in favor of taking APs for GPA boosts,
          cheating, making spreadsheets to track class rank, and more, it’s not
          hard to believe that the true essence of education has gotten lost in
          the mix. But I’ll save that stuff for another blog post. The point is,
          education should free your mind, not numb it. The problem is that
          plenty of us are feeling numb and have been for a while.

          So how do we wake ourselves up? According to the Norwegian Students’
          and Academics’ International Assistance Fund (SAIH), education and
          liberation is not something you are given, but something you achieve
          through cognition and action. Freire proposes the problem-posing
          method of education as an alternative, which presents reality as it
          truly is, prioritizes dialogue between the student and his/her
          teacher, and emphasizes critical thinking as the ultimate pathway to
          liberation. In this model, the student’s prior knowledge can be
          utilized instead of ignored to reach even greater results. A similar
          pedagogy is problem-based learning, in which students learn through
          solving open-ended problems without defined solutions, allowing them
          to develop other skills in the process. In both cases, the student is
          put at the center of the process, leaving them better equipped to
          break free from the oppressive nature of the traditional education
          dynamic.

          Ironically, I learned all of this from a course I’m currently taking
          in college. But I guess that really does show that education can be
          liberating, as long as we implement it in a way that promotes free
          exchange of thought. Only then can we truly begin the path to
          liberation.

            Note: this article does not address structural barriers to

            the idea that the education system is designed to divide the rich
