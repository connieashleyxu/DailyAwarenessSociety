          Roughly half of Harvard’s Class of 2017 who entered the workforce
          after graduation worked in the consulting, finance, and technology
          industries. Yet, when the same class was surveyed as incoming
          freshmen, only a fifth said they planned on working in those
          industries after graduation. <sup>[1]</sup>

          "Selling out" is a common expression that describes the compromising
          of a person's integrity, morality, authenticity, or principles in
          exchange for personal gain, such as money. <sup>[2]</sup> Although it
          can be applied in the context of politics, music, art, and
          entertainment, this week’s article focuses more specifically on how it
          operates on college campuses.

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Most of us have probably (or are currently) grappling with this
          dichotomy as we enter the world of higher education, in which we must
          decide between various degree pathways, navigate taxing internship and
          recruitment seasons, and balance passion vs profit and impact vs
          prestige. And to make matters worse, the environment in which all of
          this occurs — the college campuses themselves — is evolving due to the
          overpowering influence of top consulting and finance firms (think
          Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, Morgan Stanley, etc). Indra Sofian from
          Medium writes that “[o]ver decades, these firms have thoroughly and
          meticulously infiltrated and transformed the culture of these
          universities, resulting in a staggeringly high conversion rate of
          graduates into their ranks. As a result, fewer candidates are left for
          other fields that need them, such as healthcare, education, energy,
          and environmental science. It’s a very real — and very damaging —
          brain drain.” <sup>[3]</sup> Lured by promises of prestige, success,
          and safety, we gravitate towards careers that guarantee stability
          without considering the ethical implications and personal sacrifices
          that they demand. Sofian also writes: “Entire student organizations —
          like the undergraduate consulting club or a student investment
          committee — are created to shuttle high-performers into these
          companies. Concentrations and majors like economics are major
          pipelines into consulting and finance, which results in
          disproportionate numbers of students pursuing these fields of study at
          top universities.” <sup>[3]</sup> A 2017 article from the Harvard
          Crimson writes that “for seniors being coaxed by a silver platter of
          options from proactive private sector firms, the anxiety to get a job
          as quickly and painlessly as possible often leads to corporate
          capitulation. And combined with the reassuring structure of
          recruitment, the job security represented by a Bain office in a
          Manhattan skyscraper usually trumps the unsexy idealism of an unkempt
          nonprofit office in Lansing.” <sup>[4]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Of course, it’s important to note that sellout culture cannot be
          discussed without considering the structural context in which it
          occurs: a combination of a capitalistic and profit-driven society that
          values certain types of bodies, identities, and experiences over
          others. The two go hand-in-hand, and achieving such a culture change —
          one that permeates the campus of every high-ranking university — will
          require the efforts of not only the students and administration
          directly involved, but also the dismantling of the institutions that
          uphold it in the first place.
