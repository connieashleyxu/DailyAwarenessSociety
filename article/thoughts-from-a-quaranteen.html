          <strong>On Zoom University…</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I’m sure many students can relate when I say Zoom fatigue is honestly
          so tough. Sometimes, I find myself falling into robotic routines where
          all I do is move from my bed to my desk to my kitchen. On those days
          that seem to blur together, things that once motivated me turn into
          distant thoughts.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          There’s something about a Zoom call that seems so impersonal -- we see
          the faces of our professors and peers, but lack real connections. It’s
          weird to admit that I can’t imagine seeing my peers in an in-person
          setting. I often wonder if my virtual friends would be able to
          recognize me if we saw each other on the street.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Zoom University can be full of inconveniences like spotty wifi kicking
          you out of class, fear of being off mute on accident, or body aches
          from being hunched over a computer the whole day. I try not to even
          think of how fun in-person classes would have been because there’s
          really no point dwelling on what could’ve been.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          On the bright side of things, Zoom University has proved to be quite
          helpful in numerous ways. It’s now easier than ever to get to class;
          sometimes I’ll literally just wake up and go to class in a matter of
          seconds. Moreover, class has been more accessible in terms of the fact
          that we can attend class from literally anywhere. Whether we are doing
          groceries, at the gym, or in bed.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I’m not sure if I’m the only one who does this, but if my schedule is
          tight, I’ll schedule multiple Zoom meetings at the same time (but only
          on rare occasions when no other time works!). Being able to multi-task
          and knock off multiple things off your checklist at the same time has
          been easier than ever.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Admittedly, I would rather have in-person classes and opportunities,
          but I’m genuinely content with my semester and a half of Zoom
          University.
        </p>

          <strong>On Social Life…</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          As a freshman going into a new school, I wasn’t sure how my social
          life would pan out. Would I have friends to ask class questions to?
          Would I even have friends?
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I honestly think that I overthought a lot of my social life at the
          beginning of quarantine -- at the end of the day, everyone else is
          wondering the same thing, so everybody is avidly open to meeting new
          friends.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Looking back on it, I feel like I made more friends over the virtual
          setting than if classes were in person. I’ve found it easier to
          overcome that social anxiety when being virtual. Namely, my
          introduction to Clubhouse (an audio-only social app) has helped me a
          lot in terms of becoming more receptive to striking conversations with
          strangers.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I wouldn’t say I <i>lost</i> any friends, but I have become distant to
          a few of my friends. I don’t think its the fault of either party, our
          schedules just happened to not align/we thrived off of in-person
          connections.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Quite frankly, I miss my friends. While it seems like I’m always on a
          FaceTime with a friend, it’s definitely not the same as being in the
          same room.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <strong>On Self Improvement…</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          When everything was in-person, I found myself caught up in the nuances
          of others. I cared a lot about what other people were doing; where
          they were going; what new trendy restaurants are open; who people were
          with.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Since the quarantine began, I found myself become more independent yet
          more dependent. That sounds paradoxical, but let me offer an
          explanation:
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I started caring less about what others were doing. I used to have
          severe FOMO -- I would never say no to a chance to hang out with
          someone (sometimes at the cost of my well-being). However, the more I
          remained in quarantine, I was able to distance myself from these
          mildly-toxic thoughts. It’s not necessarily that people stopped
          hanging out to be COVID-cautious, it’s mainly just because I learned
          to love myself during the quarantine. Learning to be satisfied with me
          was the best thing that could’ve happened during this quarantine.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          On the flip side, I found myself more dependent on relationships that
          were important to me. I got a lot of joy from being with my family and
          close friends. Being able to have a support system during this
          quarantine was definitely a must. I noticed that I would text/call my
          friends more frequently. I think it’s important to take time for
          yourself, but also find balance and spend time with family and
          friends.
