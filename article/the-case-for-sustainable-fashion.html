          As the clock strikes midnight on November 29, I rush to H&M’s website
          in hopes of taking advantage of the store’s Black Friday sales. While
          scouring the site for trendy clothes, I remained unaware of the fact
          that my business with H&M was contributing to their gross mistreatment
          of their garment workers. The $10 sweater I purchased was a direct
          product of the company’s exploitation and abuse of female labor
          <sup>[1]</sup>. Those $8 pants I bought helped promote a culture of
          poverty among workers. In fact, in a research study conducted by the
          Clean Clothes Campaign, H&M facilities pay less than 10% of the living
          wage to their Bulgarian workers <sup>[2]</sup>.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Recently, the call to buy sustainable fashion has been amplified in
          light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most notably, Kendall + Kylie (Kendall
          and Kylie Jenner’s fashion line) has been accused of severely
          underpaying their Bangladeshi factory workers<sup>[3]</sup>. Due to
          the unexpected situations surrounding COVID, Global Brands Group
          (GBG), a corporation that owns and collaborates with various
          well-known brands like TopShop & Revolve, cancelled all their
          Spring/Summer 2020 orders. GBG, which owns factories in Bangladesh,
          then used this as an excuse to withhold payment to their employees.
          The issue of underpaying workers is not limited to Kendall + Kylie,
          however. Other large fashion authorities like Zara use slave labor in
          their Argentina sweatshops<sup>[4]</sup>. Multi-billion dollar
          companies are paying their employees less than a dollar per hour. By
          exploiting marginalized groups abroad, these companies are committing
          modern-day colonialism. Not only do conglomerations exploit these
          workers financially, the factories they work in are dangerous. In
          2013, this issue came to light when more than 1100 garment workers
          died in the collapse of Rana Plaza due to structural
          damage<sup>[5]</sup>. What happened to Rana Plaza shines light on the
          conditions of sweatshops around the world. Employees around the world
          are risking their lives for you and I to leisurely shop, and they are
          being financially robbed for it. We need to help them.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The problem with fast fashion lies not only on their labor practices
          but also their environmental impact. Companies often buy masses of
          cheap fabric to use and throw out, polluting the earth with waste. In
          2016, textiles contributed to 1.2 billion tons of greenhouse gas
          emissions <sup>[6]</sup>, and the fashion industry is responsible for
          around 10% of climate impact <sup>[7]</sup>. When factories discard
          tons of material at a time, they are severely contaminating the
          natural resources around them, impacting the living conditions of
          BIPOC who are more likely to live in such places. Again, this is
          another case of modern-day colonialism by the fashion industry!
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Unfortunately, the transition from fast to slow fashion will
          (likewise) be slow. Our society is so deeply rooted in fast fashion
          that it will take years of public pressure for these practices to be
          reversed. Because most fast fashion brands are much more inexpensive
          than sustainable counterparts*, society has grown accustomed to
          sub-$10 clothing. Admittedly, when I first tried shopping sustainable
          and saw that a basic t-shirt was $30, I was shocked. Similar to me,
          many people often use price as an excuse to cop out of buying
          sustainably. The reality is that fast fashion has destroyed our
          perception of the true cost of clothing; we've grown familiar with the
          thin, low-quality feeling of fast fashion material in exchange for the
          cheaper price, and now, we must undo that.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Sustainability doesn’t have to be pricey. If you can afford designer
          brands, you have the financial resources to also support ethical
          fashion brands. While the shift in price mindset may be initially
          difficult, those extra dollars you are spending invest directly into a
          culture of fair wages, a cleaner earth, and long-term, higher-quality
          clothing. For those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, the most
          popular sustainable alternative is thrifting/buying second-hand.** One
          thing to note though is that low-income communities are often excluded
          from the sustainable fashion movement. The suggestion above often
          comes from a place of class disconnect, and sustainable fashion brands
          should also work on making their products as affordable and accessible
          as possible (basic tees should not be $100). We won’t be able to truly
          reform fashion practices unless everyone participates, and a good
          starting point is buying sustainable basics.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Lastly, when shopping, we must also remember to promote intersectional
          sustainability. In response to environmental concerns mentioned
          earlier, fast fashion brands such as Zara and H&M have since released
          “limited-edition” or “exclusive” lines promoting eco-friendliness.
          However, the problem with this is that sustainability is not a trend.
          True sustainable fashion requires the revolution of the company’s
          entire philosophy. H&M Conscious line or Zara’s “Join Life” Campaign
          should not be chic alternatives but rather universal products. This
          ties into intersectionality/race because these large corporations are
          often led by non-marginalized people! BIPOC-owned businesses do not
          have nearly as much public presence as these companies do but have
          been practicing sustainability much longer. Thus, we should support
          minority-owned businesses while pressuring larger brands to reform. In
          the end, the goal is not to tear these companies down but rather
          rebuild them into something better.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          When I was young, I never put too much thought into the “Made in
          Bangladesh” tag on my shirt. To me, that shirt was just another piece
          of clothing I wore for comfort. Yet, looking back now, a garment
          worker may have sacrificed their life for me to comfortably wear that
          shirt. We, as consumers, have the power to pay these sacrifices back,
          and it should be our duty to do so.

          4) LAST BUT NOT LEAST, promoting sustainability does not only apply to
          the fashion industry! While this article focuses more on fashion,
          similar instances of marginalized communities being abused by the
          upper ruling class have been occurring in the food industry (Re:
          Driscolls’ underpaying farmworkers), e-commerce (Re: Amazon warehouse
          conditions), retail (Re: Walmart), and more. Before you purchase an
          item, try to conduct some research on the company and find (if
          applicable) better alternatives.

            *Luxury brands such as Gucci/Versace, while expensive, are not
            excluded from “fast fashion.” Many high fashion brands continue to
            take advantage of garment workers in foreign countries. Rana Plaza
            Collapse is just one example of their involvement. <br />
