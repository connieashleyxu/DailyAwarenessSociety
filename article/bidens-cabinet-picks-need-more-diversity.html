        <p class="paragraph">
          Over the past few weeks, President-Elect Biden has announced several
          of his Cabinet picks, some of which will be historical nominations.
          Janet Yellen, former Chair of the Federal Reserve, has been nominated
          as the next Secretary of Treasury and will be the first woman in
          that position. While we should celebrate such achievements,
          there’s still much work to be done. Biden’s promise he made to “select
          a Cabinet that represents America” has not held true. Much of Biden’s
          nominees for some of this country’s most powerful positions are white
          and upper-class, a stark contrast to the true demographics of the US.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Currently, Biden's cabinet consists of UN Ambassador nominee Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a Black woman, Secretary of Homeland
          Security nominee Alejandro Mayorkas, the first Latino to serve in the position,
          and Neera Tanden, the first woman of color and South
          Asian person Office of Management and Budget director.
          Cecilia Rouse is also the first woman of color to serve as the
          chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.<sup>[1]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Minority voters were the voices that lifted Biden to victory.
          According to exit polls, Asian, Black, Latino, and other ethnic
          minorities all favored Biden while a majority of White voters favored
          Trump.<sup>[2]</sup> Black grassroots organizers such as Stacey
          Abrams, Helen Butler, Tamieka Atkins, and more deserve credit for
          registering 800,000+ Georgia voters, pushing Georgia blue. For these
          groups, a vote for Biden meant a step towards equality and acceptance.
          It meant having our voices finally heard. Representation for these
          groups at the highest levels of government are crucial. We need the
          Biden-Harris administration to nominate a diverse cabinet so that the
          voices of all of America heard. Yet, the current picks to this point
          have been so disappointing that Black, Latino, and AAPI groups such as
          the NAACP, Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Congressional Asian
          Pacific American Caucus have been forced to write to President-Elect
          Biden to encourage him to fill more high-profile positions with
          minorities. As a response, Biden has said, "I'm not going to tell you
          now exactly what I'm doing in any department, but I promise you, it'll
          be the single most diverse cabinet, based on race, color, based on
          gender, that's ever existed in the United States of America.”
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          There are still several key cabinet positions remaining, including
          Secretary of Education, Secretary of Health and Human Services,
          Attorney General, and Secretary of Justice. For many, voting for Biden
          meant voting for a President and administration that would genuinely
          speak for them both economically and socially. Having a Cabinet member
          that represents various demographics means picking someone who knows
          the problems these groups of people face and has the power to fix
          them. A Hispanic nominee for HHS Secretary, for example, is important
          as COVID-19 has disproportionately rampaged in Black and Latinx
          communities. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has been a
          favorite among Hispanic and Latino lawmakers for this spot as she was
          one of the first leaders to enact a stay-at-home order, close schools,
          and pass a stimulus bill in her state when the disease spread in
          March.<sup>[3]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          It’s important to note that diversity is not only limited to ethnicity
          and race, but also gender, economic class, sexual orientation, and
          political view. Progressives such as AOC and Ilhan Omar notably held
          Among Us Twitch streams to push young voters to get out and vote. All
          of these groups mobilized millions of voters in order to put Biden in
          the White House. As January and Biden’s inauguration date nears, I
          hope to see a true America reflected in Biden’s top Cabinet picks,
          signaling that he values the people who helped him throughout his
          campaign.
