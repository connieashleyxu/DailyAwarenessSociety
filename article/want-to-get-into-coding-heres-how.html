          In our society, technology is so deeply rooted in everything we do,
          and code is the center of it all. Coding opens an avenue of
          opportunities for you to start making lasting impacts in the tech
          field one line at a time.

          Whether you are a liberal arts major in college, a bored high school
          student, an adult just looking to learn a new skill, or anyone in
          between, coding is something you should highly consider learning.
          Coding improves your communication and collaborative skills in
          addition to teaching logic. <sup>[1]</sup> As Steve Jobs once said,

          1) <strong>Make sure you have the right equipment</strong>, which is
          essentially just a functioning laptop (or monitor/desktop). If you
          want to get serious about coding, it may help to upgrade your
          computer.

          liked Mac better (completely personal preference). The Mac was
          definitely more expensive, but there are some applications that are

        <div class="paragraph">

            <li><strong>C/C++/C#:</strong> Object-oriented programming</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Swift/Kotlin:</strong> Swift is for iOS; Kotlin is for
              Android (both are object-oriented programming for app development)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ruby:</strong> Object-oriented programming (back-end);
              Ruby is easier to learn because it’s closer to the English
              language as a higher-level language
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Python:</strong> Used a lot in machine learning/artificial

          including myself, it may be difficult to learn something completely
          foreign without a little bit of guidance and structure. So, I highly
          recommend <strong>attending a coding camp and/or workshop</strong>.*
          This way, there is a curriculum you can follow, and you will have the
          help of instructors and peers throughout the program.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          You can also <strong>enroll in an online class</strong>, as it
          provides a similar level of structure.*

            <li>
              If you are interested in web development, start with learning HTML
              and CSS as these are the easiest of the languages to learn.<br /><br />
              I recommend coding in
              <a class="a" href="https://glitch.com/" target="_blank">Glitch</a

              <a class="a" href="https://repl.it/" target="_blank">Repl.it</a>
              for your IDEs because they are all fully online and automatically
              saves your work as your code.<br /><br />
              To actually learn HTML/CSS, <strong>Code Academy</strong> offers

              Next, you can start learning an object-oriented language like
              JavaScript or C++.<br /><br />
              I recommend coding in
              <a class="a" href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a>

              <a

              >.<br /><br />
              Or, if you are coding for app development, I recommend using
              <a
                class="a"
                href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12"

              (for iOS) or

              Once you learn one object-oriented coding language, you basically
              know all of them -- it’s just a matter of learning different
              syntax.

          9) <strong>Keep practicing and learning.</strong> Here are some
          parting tips that are important to internalize as you embark on your
          learning adventures with code:
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The learning process takes time and PRACTICE.</strong>
              Don’t expect to be a coding genius in a week; if it were that
              easy, there wouldn’t be such a high demand for coders. Understand
              that this is a time commitment. Just like with sports/playing
              instruments, you can’t get really good until you’ve practiced as
              the skills don’t come overnight. So, don’t give up!!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Don’t rush into things</strong>, take your time, and enjoy
              the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Learning from your mistakes is the best way to learn</strong
              >; and trust me, there will be A LOT of mistakes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fastest and most efficient way to learn code, in my opinion,
              is to <strong>go to a coding boot camp</strong> because it’ll hold
              you accountable and ensure that you have somewhere to go with your
              questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>GOOGLE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND.</strong> If you have the right
              questions, you will find just about everything you are looking
              for. It would also be helpful to learn how to read the formatting
              of
              <a class="a" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank"
                >Stack Overflow</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >There really isn’t a moment where “you know everything there is
                to know” in code</strong
              >
              because there’s always more to know as new things are developing
              every day; so, you will constantly be learning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It takes time to find what you like to do.</strong> Coding
              is a big world, and you might only like a part of it (or all of
              it) and both are perfectly OK!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          10) <strong>Be mindful of your impact.</strong> As you get into the
          tech and/or coding field, it’s important to stay cognizant of the
          disparities that happen in the field.

            >“Code: Debugging the Gender Gap”</a
          >
          on Amazon Prime; the documentary was released in 2015 and brings up
          many interesting points about women in STEM. While this documentary
          doesn’t address the disparities of womxn in STEM, it still brings
          great perspectives on what it’s like not being a male in the industry.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          <a class="a" href="https://wistemsymposium.com/" target="_blank"
            >Brown’s WiSTEM</a
          >
          said it best, the reason we say womxn as opposed to women is that “As
          micro-aggressions work to subtly enforce sexist ideals and tendencies
          among individuals, the word ‘women’ subtly enforces the concept that
          womxn are second to men. The orthography is intersectional and is used
          to stress visually the symposiums inclusive approach to gender and
          gender identity. The Symposium values diversity. We encourage womxn
          from historically under-represented groups, and femme, trans-womxn,
          and non-binary persons in STEM fields to apply.”
