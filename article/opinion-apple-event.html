          Apple held its annual iPhone event on Tuesday, October 13. They
          released 4 new iPhones including the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone
          12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. They also released the HomePod mini, an
          addition to the HomePod family.

          <strong>iPhone 12 Family</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          The iPhone 12 serves as an update to the previous iPhone 11. The
          iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max serve as updates to the previous
          iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. The iPhone 12 mini is a new
          addition to the iPhone family, with its 5.4-inch screen. All new
          iPhone 12 models feature a new design similar to that of the current
          iPad Pro and iPad Air models. The new iPhones have a more squared
          design and come in all-new colors.

        />

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          The key changes for all new iPhone 12 models include support for 5G,
          improved displays, support for MagSafe accessories, new chips, better
          cameras, and supposedly more drop-proof bodies with Apple and
          Corning’s new “Ceramic Shield” material.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          The pro models include the additional telephoto lens for zooming into
          photos without losing image quality, night mode portraits, and “HDR
          video recording with Dolby Vision up to 60 fps” compared to the
          non-pro iPhone 12’s “HDR video recording with Dolby Vision up to 30
          fps”. The pro models also have a LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging)
          scanner to enable faster autofocus in darker lighting environments
          when taking photos and AR (augmented reality) applications.

          <strong>HomePod Mini</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          The new HomePod mini serves as a cheaper alternative to the original
          HomePod, coming in at $99. Apple spoke about its 360-degree audio and
          a feature where you can take a song you are listening to on your
          iPhone and transfer the audio to the HomePod by placing your phone
          next to it. The HomePod mini is also capable of detecting different
          users based on voice, making it personalized towards the user asking
          Siri questions.

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          I found the Apple Event to be underwhelming. The upgrades to the
          iPhone family were pretty minor in my opinion. 5G is currently not
          widely available and is also battery-consuming. According to industry
          trade group GSMA, around half of the mobile connections will be 5G by
          2025<sup>[1]</sup>. With this in mind, I would say that it’s not worth
          buying a new iPhone 12 model solely because of 5G.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Other upgrades such as the processor and cameras are not incredibly
          selling points to the average consumer. I found the MagSafe
          accessories to be pretty interesting and exciting, but these
          accessories are also not bundled with your iPhone 12 if you decide to
          buy one; this means Apple has created another area for you to spend
          your money in, alongside a new case and screen protector.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          The HomePod mini didn’t really excite me or disappoint me. It’s a
          typical smart speaker, just smaller. If you loved the original
          HomePod, you’ll love this one as well.
        </p>

          <strong>Opinion 2</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          I am an avid Apple user. All of my products are Apple, which allows me
          to sync all of my data and information easily. Because of this, it is
          very hard for me to switch to a Samsung phone or a Google pixel. Their
          technology is so much more advanced and customizable compared to
          Apple.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          I was definitely hoping for more upgraded features such as a 120 Hz
          refresh rate on the screens, but I think Apple only stuck to upgrading
          one feature, which was just 5G capabilities.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          I am also a little disappointed because the notch on the iPhone is
          still there and has not shrunk either. In comparison to Samsung
          phones, the notch has disappeared and the front camera takes up just a
          circle of space on the front screen. I was expecting there to be more
          upgrades, but the only major change I can see is the shape of the
          iPhone has changed to a more “boxy” look.

          <strong>Our iPhone Recommendation</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          If you have a fully functional iPhone X or newer model, there really
          is no need to upgrade to the new iPhone 12 models. Overall, there have
          not been many new innovations that customers will see huge differences
          with.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          If you are planning on upgrading your iPhone but are not sure which
          model (iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, or iPhone 12 Pro Max)
          you want, here are our recommendations. If you want a super large
          phone, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is basically your only choice (for the
          average person’s hand, it is extremely large and is very hard to use
          one hand to type). If you want a flagship iPhone that is not too
          large, the iPhone 12 is your choice. We recommend the 12 over the 12
          Pro because the differences in terms of features are not massive and
          the 12 costs $200 less. We recommend getting the iPhone 12 Pro over
          the iPhone 12 if you find the telephoto lens to be important to have
          or you are a super passionate/professional iPhone photographer who
          wants the capabilities of Apple’s ProRAW image format.
