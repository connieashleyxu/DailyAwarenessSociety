          With the new school semester and new year here, I am working on making
          some changes in the way I approach goal-setting. After a couple of
          TikToks regarding self-care and self-improvement popped up on my “for
          you page”, I decided to dive into the topic and discovered that there
          is a lot of reframing for me to do.

          <b>First, what is the difference between goals and systems?</b>

          Goals are the final destination whereas systems are the process. Some
          issues that I face when intensely focusing on a long-term goal include
          feelings of self-doubt or not feeling worthy enough in the present.
          It’s important to not attach self-worth to reaching a goal, but
          instead, focus on the process and make small steps towards larger
          goals.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Setting a system can be helpful in realizing your dreams and
          understanding what work needs to be done to get there. Taking the time
          and dedication to set a routine or plan can make all the difference in
          reaching and extending beyond your goals.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <b>But goals are great too!</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          <!--paragraph-->
          While researching this topic, I saw arguments on the flipside. Goals
          are also important because they shape the way we form systems. Without
          goals, it may be difficult to know what steps to take or how to
          formulate a feasible plan.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The important takeaway is that there needs to be a balance of
          growth-thinking and goal-thinking. The two approaches work well
          together and are equally valuable. Here are some guidelines you can
          follow when establishing your goals and systems:

          <b>Here are two quotes that highlight the points mentioned</b> (feel
          free to add them to your Notion pages like I do :P):
        </p>

        <blockquote class="quote">
          “The thought that you need to improve sends a message that you aren’t
          enough even though you always are!” (from TikTok)
        </blockquote>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I would like to add that it’s important to realize that you are enough
          and that you are capable of growing to accomplish what you hope to
          accomplish.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="quote">
          “Happiness brings success. Love your life now and use gratitude
          journaling to rewire your brain to an abundance mindset instead of
          chasing goals to fill the lack of feeling.” (also from TikTok)
        </blockquote>

        <p class="paragraph">
          This is another technique that some use to remember things to be
          grateful for and to stay present and “in the moment” while working
          towards goals.
        </p>

        <hr
          style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black"
        />

        <p class="paragraph">
          As you work towards your goals, realize that it takes time, practice,
          and discipline. At the same time, affirm yourself that you are
          capable. Surround yourself with a supportive and like-minded community
          that pushes you to be your best.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          System-setting and goal-setting can be difficult; it will take time,
          self-reflection, and dedication. But it is also rewarding and
          exciting, you can do it!
