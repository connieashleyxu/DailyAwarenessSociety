          Okay, first of all, I know this book review is embarrassingly late to
          the party. Although <i>Know My Name</i> was published just last year,
          most of us had at least heard about what happened when it made
          headlines in 2015: a Stanford swimmer raped a girl behind a dumpster
          at a frat party, the media focused too much on his clean track record
          and potential as an athlete, he was only sentenced to six months in
          county jail, wait hold on what the fuck how does raping someone equate
          to six months in jail. A classic example of white male privilege and a
          true embodiment of everything wrong with the criminal justice system
          and its handling of sexual assault. My friends and I had all read
          about it online, sent each other articles denouncing rape culture,
          retweeted posts supporting the victim, and shaken our heads at the
          system. But before long, much like any other devastating piece of news
          that makes its way to the trending page on Twitter, the story
          eventually faded from our conversations. When I found out the victim
          had released a memoir about the incident several years later, my
          interest slightly peaked. The book received raving reviews,
          international praise, and was an instant
          <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. And yet, I never got around to
          reading it (see: “gifted kid burnout”) until now, when it became my
          summer reading assignment for college. And I am so glad I did.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          I think <i>The Wrap’s </i>review on the back cover summarizes it best:
          we are given “the privilege of knowing [the author] not just as Emily
          Doe, but as Chanel Miller the writer, the artist, the survivor, the
          fighter.”<sup>[1]</sup> It isn’t enough to just say that this book is
          beautifully written, because that wouldn’t do it justice. Miller
          writes in a way that plants the reader directly and firmly into her
          shoes, regardless of their own experiences with sexual assault, so
          that they are with her through every emotion, interaction, setback,
          and victory. When she wrote about anxiously waiting for the jury’s
          decision during the early stages of trial, my heart beat faster and my
          palms moistened, even though I had already known the result. When she
          wrote about feeling the need to protect her younger sister from harsh
          interrogations and court procedures even though she was the victim, my
          heart softened and somehow I understood, despite being the younger
          sibling in my family. It even feels weird to refer to her as “Miller”
          instead of “Chanel” as I write this, because it’s almost as if I know
          her personally and we’re already on a first name basis. If I were to
          highlight the sentences and paragraphs in the book that resonated
          especially strongly with me, there would be more yellow than white.
          But the following is worth mentioning:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="quote">
          <!--quote-->
          “I was waiting to be knocked back down to size, to the small place I
          imagined I belonged. I had grown up in the margins; in the media Asian
          Americans were assigned side roles, submissive, soft-spoken secondary
          characters. I had grown used to being unseen, to never being fully
          known. It did not feel possible that I could be the protagonist. The
          more recognition I gained, the more I felt I was not supposed to be on
          the receiving end of so much generosity. Yet people kept pulling me up
          and up, until I heard from the highest house in our nation.”
        </blockquote>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          To strike so deeply about an issue as dark and sensitive as rape takes
          a unique type of talent, one that Miller has mastered well as a
          writer; to connect it to external themes of race, self-image, and
          power dynamics is another thing entirely. It was through this in which
          I realized that she and I had gone through similar struggles even
          before her assault — that I could have been her, that sexual assault
          can happen to anyone. Miller is living proof that victims are
          multifaceted, dimensional human beings defined by much much more than
          their trauma.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Miller bares her soul and reveals her wounds openly and unabashedly
          through her writing, allowing us to step into her life for just a
          moment to look beneath the headlines and news reports. To understand
          the pain and loss that comes with every rape statistic we read about,
          and to recognize that the one isolated incident we hear about carries
          lifelong implications, not only on the victim but on those around her
          as well. Her strength shines through her vulnerability, and she
          literally and metaphorically takes the narrative back into her own
          hands. Her humor, wit, intelligence, and artistry firmly establish her
          as a force to be reckoned with, something that stands true to this day
          through the

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          <i>Know My Name</i> is the first book I’ve read, purely for my own
          enjoyment, in several years. Miller’s writing has inspired me to jump
          back into reading, and it has forever changed the way I view cases of
          sexual assault and rape. It should be on <i>everyone’s</i> reading
          list because it transcends themes of gender, age, race, and identity;
          further, as Jennifer Weiner of The <i>New York Times</i> writes, “it
          especially deserves to be read by the next generation of young men,
          the could-be Brocks and Elliots, who have grown up seeing women’s
          bodies as property to plunder, who believe that sex is their
          right.”<sup>[2]</sup> If we as a society are to effectively combat and
          overcome sexual violence and the customs and institutions that
          normalize it, we must believe and amplify those who have been most
          impacted, whether they are renowned writers like Chanel Miller, or
          simply our friends, relatives, and peers.
