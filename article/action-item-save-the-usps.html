          <!--paragraph-->
          With every election season comes a new set of conflicts and
          challenges, and the 2020 election season is no exception. While the
          U.S. is still battling the novel Coronavirus pandemic, the political
          polarization between liberals and conservatives has only been rising.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          On Wednesday, August 12th, President Trump revealed that he was going
          to block needed funding to the United States Postal Service (USPS).
          But, how does this impact the voting season?
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          With COVID-19, heading to in-person polls can be dangerous for
          high-risk voters. While some states have already made the needed
          accommodations to make voting registration, mail-in voting, and
          in-person voting safer during this pandemic, there are still a large
          number of states that are not prepared for the November election time
          during a pandemic.<sup>[1]</sup> One of the safest ways of voting
          during a pandemic is offering the option for mail-in voting. However,
          in order to accommodate the larger influx of voting ballots by mail,
          funding would need to be allocated towards the U.S. Postal Service.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Looping back around to August 12th, Trump told Fox Business Network
          that he will be “holding up funding” to the USPS.<sup>[2]</sup> Later
          that week, Trump admitted that he did not choose to provide USPS the
          funding it needed to make it harder for mail-in ballots to be
          processed because he claims that mail-in ballots lead to increased
          voter fraud.<sup>[3]</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          However, there is research to show that election fraud is rare in
          mail-in voting.<sup>[4]</sup> In other words, there should be no fear
          of this election season being “the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT
          Election” (as Trump tweeted on July 30) because of mail-in
          ballots.<sup>[5]</sup> Moreover, mail-in ballots do not favor one
          political party over another, and both liberals and conservatives will
          be able to vote in the safest way possible amidst a rampaging
          pandemic.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          There are a couple of key facts to take from Trump’s recent actions.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          First, in order to make democracy in the U.S. as fair as it can be, it
          is crucial that everyone who is eligible to vote is able to do so.
          States like California, Washington, and Colorado are making efforts to
          ensure the safety of its voters throughout the entire process (from
          registering to voting, whether it may be via mail or in-person).
          Therefore, it is completely possible for other states to follow suit
          and ensure safe alternatives for voters to allow them to fulfill their
          civic duty without fear of contracting COVID-19. With stunted funding
          for the USPS, states can no longer ensure the mail-in option for their
          voters, therefore censoring an entire group of potential voters that
          could change the election results.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          The second problem lies in the fact that the USPS employs “more than
          97,000 military veterans” and is one of the leading postal services in
          the U.S.<sup>[6]</sup> In these unprecedented circumstances, there are
          so many workers fighting to keep an income to live. With USPS losing
          needed funding, the jobs of millions are at risk. Given that we are in
          an election season and we are living through a pandemic, everybody
          needs the USPS. The Trump Administration needs to be providing funding
          to the USPS which would in turn help millions of Americans with not
          only their right to vote, but also some with their livelihoods.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          Currently, there are two bills that could drastically save the USPS.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">

          >
          “This bill repeals the requirement that the U.S. Postal Service
          annually prepay future retirement health benefits.” <br /><br />
          2)
          <a
            class="a"

            ><strong>H.R.6800 - The Heroes Act.</strong></a
          >
          “This bill responds to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019)
          outbreak and its impact on the economy, public health, state and local
          governments, individuals, and businesses.”
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          We need the USPS to ensure our votes can be counted properly. The
          change to make sure we have a better future coming out of this
          election season starts with you.

          What can YOU do to save the post office?
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <!--paragraph-->
          1) <strong>Buy stamps.</strong> The USPS receives a lot of its funding
          via stamps. Check out their cool collection of stamps

          6) If you are qualified, <strong>register to vote</strong> if you have
          not already. Every vote counts!<br />

            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >.<br /><br />
          7) <strong>Vote early</strong> to ensure the USPS has enough time to
          process your mail-in voting ballots.<br />
          Check out the
          <a
            class="a"

            >voting calendar</a
          >
          to see when in-person early voting begins in your state. As soon as
          early voting begins in your state, go out and vote!<br /><br />
          You can also request an <strong>absentee mail-in ballot </strong
          ><a
            class="a"
            href="https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot/"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >. If you live in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, or Mississippi, you will
          need a legitimate excuse as to why you need an absentee voting ballot.
          If you live in New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, or South
          Dakota, your states have loosened the required excuse for absentee
          ballot rule, but not yet for the November election.<br /><br />

            >Request your absentee mail-in ballot TODAY! Then, mail in your
            ballot ASAP!</strong
