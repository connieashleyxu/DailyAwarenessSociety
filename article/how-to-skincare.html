            ><b>UPDATE (12/11/2020)</b>: In a previous version of this article,
            we recommended the Purito Unscented Centella Sunscreen. As of
            December 2020, Purito has made an announcment regarding the SPF
            level of some of their sunscreens including this one. They are
            conducting lab tests which will take approximately 2-3 months. Due
            to this new information, we can no longer recommend this product at
            this time.</i

          Skincare is extremely important, whether it’s for treating acne,
          preventing anti-aging, or just protecting yourself from the sun and
          the potential of developing skin cancer. In this article, we will be
          discussing the skincare basics: the 3 main skin types, the importance
          of having a skincare routine, and our recommendations to help you get
          started.* (We will discuss our experiences with tackling specific
          skincare concerns such as acne and hyperpigmentation in future
          articles.)
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The 3 main types of skin are oily, combination, and dry.<sup
            >[2] [3] </sup
          >Note that you can be a combination of these skin types; for example
          you can be normal to oily. Your skin can also be drier during the
          colder months and more oily during the hotter months.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Oily</strong> skin is characterized by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>shiny face</li>
          <li>enlarged pores</li>
          <li>large number of blackheads and whiteheads</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <strong>Combination</strong> skin is characterized by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>oily T-zone (area above eyebrows and down on your nose)</li>
          <li>dry skin on cheeks and other areas</li>

        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Dry</strong> skin is characterized by:</p>

          Something that I have learned through my experiences with treating
          acne is that it is so so so important to maintain a healthy skin
          barrier. Your skin barrier is the first defense to all external
          threats and helps maintain the delicate balance of your body.
          <sup>[4]</sup> If you are using a chemical exfoliator every single
          day, that can make it super easy for your skin barrier to become
          compromised. Remember that your skin is intelligent and the purpose of
          your skin is to serve as the first line of defense. If you are
          constantly stripping your skin of its natural oils, your skin will not
          be able to properly do its job and you may find yourself with
          sensitive, red, and even more acne-prone skin. Even though I have oily
          skin, I still prefer hydrating cleansers and hydrating treatment
          formulas for my acne.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote class="quote">
          Identifying which type of skin you have is crucial to choosing
          products so that you can best complement and avoid irritating your
          skin. One mistake that I made when I was younger was not choosing the
          correct products for my skin. I thought that I had oily skin, when in
          reality I had combination skin. I used harsh products that would suck
          all the oil out of my face and even in places where my face wasn’t
          oily. This made my face extremely dry. If only I had learned sooner
          what skin type I have!

          It is essential that you develop a skincare routine to keep your skin
          healthy and protected from damaging UV rays. Your routine does not
          have to be elaborate or expensive. It can be simple and personalized
          for you.

          A general skincare routine consists of an oil-based cleanser,
          water-based cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Oil-based cleansers
          are good for removing makeup, sunscreen, and oils on the skin in a
          hydrating, non-stripping manner. We recommend using an oil-based
          cleanser because just doing a single-cleanse with a water-based
          cleanser might not effectively remove all your makeup or sunscreen
          (**from chemistry class, “like dissolves like” - if you don’t use an
          oil-based cleanser, the excess oils on your skin won’t be cleaned
          off). You should follow up with a water-based cleanser to cleanse the
          skin of any residue from the oil-based cleanser. After cleansing, use
          a moisturizer to hydrate the skin and seal in moisture. This is
          important for a healthy, strong skin barrier. Finally, protect your
          skin with sunscreen. We have listed some recommendations below.

          I have been using this cleanser for over 5 years and it is the ACTUAL
          BEST. It works so well in getting my makeup off and leaves my face
          super moisturized. The actual container comes with a scoop to help get
          the product out. To use, you simply scoop your desired amount onto
          your dry, clean hand. Then, without using any water, gently massage
          the product all over your face to dissolve your makeup and sunscreen.
          After you finish, clean off the cleanser and excess makeup with water.
          The product will start to emulsify and wash right off your face! (POV:

          This cleanser has worked so well for me! I have many holy grail
          products and this one is definitely on that list! I used it all
          throughout my extreme acne times, helping cleanse my face of all
          excess oils and still hydrate my face at the same time. It doesn’t
          strip my skin but still leaves it squeaky clean afterwards! To use,
          simply squeeze a pea sized amount and lather in your hands. Massage

          This is my favorite cleanser at the moment because of its hydrating
          formula. It comes out of the tube as a gel and builds up into a mild
          foam as you add water to it. I prefer using a hydrating and gentle
          product for my cleansing step because I know I will be using active
          treatments for my acne in other parts of my skincare routine. I’d like
          to also point out that I don’t use a cleanser in the morning and I
          only use water for quick rinse. I have personally found that this
          helps me with maintaining my skin barrier and preventing the
          possibility of irritation. (POV: oily skin)

          I recently got this moisturizer after seeing it all over TikTok being
          promoted by Hyram (skincare KING). I wanted to try it because of Hyram
          and the fact that it’s so affordable for such a large amount of
          moisturizer (I had been using a very expensive moisturizer before that
          had less product than this moisturizer). This moisturizer is so nice
          for anyone because it moisturizes my face without making it extremely
          oily. This is also great for during the day because then I can apply
          makeup on top without it getting messed up. This is also great for
          beginning skincare fanatics because this product is found at any local
          drugstore! (POV: combination skin)

        <p class="paragraph">
          I also love this moisturizer because of how much product you get for
          the price. It’s lightweight and easy to press into the skin. I find it
          to be extremely hydrating and doesn’t leave your skin with a super
          greasy finish. (POV: oily skin)

          I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this sunscreen because it is SO
          LIGHTWEIGHT, leaves NO WHITECAST, and does not smell like you are
          going to the beach. This sunscreen is the best sunscreen I have ever
          used. Not only does this sunscreen do everything I just mentioned
          above, it also dries MATTE, which is so great for me to apply makeup
          right after and great for anyone else because you won’t look shiny
